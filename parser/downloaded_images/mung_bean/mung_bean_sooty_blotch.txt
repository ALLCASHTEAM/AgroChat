Mung bean is a horticultural crop1 2, which means it is grown for its edible seeds and sprouts and not for its fibers, grains, or oil. Mung bean coal stain is a fungal disease3 , which means it is caused by a fungus that infects the seeds and causes symptoms such as black spots, discoloration, or rotting.
The pathogenic fungus of mung bean coal stain is Ulocladium atrum3 , which reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind, water, or insects. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of mung bean coal stain are influenced by high humidity and temperature4 . The fungus survives on infected seeds, plant debris, soil, or weeds3 . The conidia are spread by wind, water, insects, or contaminated equipment3 and infect the seeds during storage or germination3 .
The period of disease onset for mung bean coal stain varies depending on the environmental conditions and the seed quality3 . The disease can infect seeds at any stage of their storage or germination3 , but symptoms usually appear on stored seeds after 6 months or on germinating seeds after 2 days3 . The disease can reduce seed viability, germination rate, and yield3 . The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity (above 80%) and high temperature (above 25Г‚В°C)3 . The fungus also prefers poorly ventilated and dark storage conditions and acidic soil (pH below 6)3 .
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected seeds, especially mung bean seeds that are stored in humid and warm conditions3 . The fungus can also overwinter on plant debris, especially mung bean stems and leaves that are left in the field or in compost piles3 . The fungus can also overwinter on soil or weeds, such as chickweed, lambsquarters, or pigweed3 .
Fungicides such as thiram, carbendazim, or captan can be applied to the seeds before storage or sowing to prevent or reduce the infection1 . The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the fungus1 .
Infected seeds can be sorted out and destroyed to prevent the spread of the fungus1 . However, this may not be feasible for large-scale production or severe infection1 .
A biofungicide such as Trichoderma harzianum can be used to suppress the fungus1 . Trichoderma harzianum is a beneficial fungus that competes with and antagonizes the pathogen1 .
Seed treatment, crop rotation, seedbed sanitation, weed control, proper storage conditions, and using resistant varieties are some of the cultural practices that can reduce the risk of infection1 .
["Black spots or patches on the seed coat, ranging from 0.5 to 2 mm in diameter1", "Discoloration or darkening of the seed coat, ranging from brown to black1", "Rotting or shriveling of the seed embryo or cotyledons1", "Reduced seed viability, germination rate, and yield1"]
["Presence of conidia (asexual spores) of Ulocladium atrum on the seed surface or in the lesions1", "Conidia are ellipsoidal to cylindrical, dark brown to black, and have one or more septa (cross-walls)1", "Conidia can be observed under a microscope or with a hand lens1"]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some possible factors are: The mechanism of resistance may involve the ability of the fungus to detoxify or degrade the fungicides, or to alter the target site or metabolic pathway of the fungicides . The type of resistance agent may depend on the type of fungicide used, such as thiram, carbendazim, or captan1 . Some studies have reported reduced sensitivity of Ulocladium atrum to carbendazim . The level of resistance may vary depending on the environmental conditions, the fungal population, and the frequency and dose of fungicide application . Resistance may also be influenced by the presence of other pathogens or beneficial microbes . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is: Collecting seed samples with typical symptoms of coal stain1. Placing the samples in a moist chamber or a ziplock bag with wet paper towel overnight1. Examining the samples under a microscope or with a hand lens for the presence of conidia (asexual spores) of Ulocladium atrum on the seed surface or in the lesions1. Comparing the morphology and color of the conidia with reference images or descriptions1 . Conidia are ellipsoidal to cylindrical, dark brown to black, and have one or more septa (cross-walls)1 . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but some possible aspects are: The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but they may include enzymes, toxins, or proteins that facilitate infection, colonization, or evasion of host defense . The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host susceptibility, resistance genes, or defense responses . Some mung bean varieties have resistance to coal stain conferred by a single gene (Ua) located on chromosome 9 . The process of infestation may involve the following steps1 : The conidia land on the seed surface and germinate under moist conditions. The germ tubes penetrate the seed coat and infect the embryo or cotyledons. The hyphae grow inside the seed tissue and form lesions. The fungus produces more conidia on the seed surface or in the lesions. The conidia are dispersed by wind, water, insects, or contaminated equipment to new infection sites. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well identified, but some possible candidates are: Knockout lethal genes that are essential for fungal growth, development, or pathogenicity . These genes may be involved in cell wall synthesis, signal transduction, metabolism, stress response, or virulence factors. Host resistance genes that confer protection against fungal infection . These genes may encode receptors, transcription factors, defense enzymes, or antimicrobial compounds.
