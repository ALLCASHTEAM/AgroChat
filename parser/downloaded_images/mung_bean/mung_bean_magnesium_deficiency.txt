Magnesium deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogen, but a physiological disorder that affects the plant's growth and development. It occurs when the plant cannot absorb enough magnesium from the soil or when there is an imbalance of other nutrients. Since magnesium deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogen, there is no mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus. Therefore, I do not have an answer for this question.
Since magnesium deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogen, there is no epidemiological pattern or mode of transmission of this disorder. It depends on the soil conditions and the plant's nutritional status. The period of disease onset for magnesium deficiency varies depending on the crop stage and the severity of the disorder. Generally, magnesium deficiency symptoms appear first on the older leaves of the plant, as magnesium is a mobile nutrient that can be translocated from older to younger tissues. The symptoms include interveinal chlorosis, or yellowing between the leaf veins, which may turn reddish or brown in some cases. The leaf margins may also curl up or down. If the deficiency is severe, the plant may have stunted growth, reduced yield and poor quality.
The environmental conditions required for magnesium deficiency are mainly related to the soil factors that affect the availability and uptake of magnesium by the plant. Some of these factors are: low soil pH, high calcium or potassium levels, high soil moisture, low soil temperature, sandy or coarse-textured soils, and high organic matter content. Magnesium deficiency can also be induced by excessive application of nitrogen, phosphorus or potassium fertilizers, which can interfere with magnesium absorption. Since magnesium deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogen, there is no overwintering method of this disorder. It can persist or recur in the same or different crops if the soil conditions are not corrected or improved.

Applying magnesium fertilizers such as magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) or magnesium oxide to the soil or as a foliar spray can correct magnesium deficiency. The application dose, period and number of applications depend on the soil test results, crop stage and deficiency severity. Generally, a rate of 10-25 kg/ha of magnesium sulfate or 5-10 kg/ha of magnesium oxide is recommended for soil application, and a rate of 2-5 kg/ha of magnesium sulfate is recommended for foliar spray.
There are no specific physical measures for controlling magnesium deficiency in mung bean, except for improving soil drainage and aeration to enhance root growth and nutrient uptake.
There are no known biological agents that can control or prevent magnesium deficiency in mung bean.
Adopting good agronomic practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, organic matter incorporation, liming acidic soils, avoiding excessive nitrogen, phosphorus or potassium fertilization, and selecting tolerant varieties can help prevent or reduce the risk of magnesium deficiency in mung bean.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease, such as the mechanism of resistance, the type of resistance agent, and the level of resistance, etc.: The study suggested that the metabolites of P. janczewskii inhibited the growth and development of P. herbarum by affecting the expression of a gene (StSTE12) involved in the appressorium formation and penetration. The study also performed in silico analysis to understand the role of Ste12, a transcription factor in the MAPK signaling pathway, which regulates various cellular processes in fungi. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: The symptoms include small, circular to irregular spots on leaves and stems, which later become grayish-brown with dark margins. The spots may coalesce and cause defoliation and premature senescence. The signs include black dots (pycnidia) on the spots, which contain spores (conidia) that are hyaline, cylindrical and septate. The disease can be confirmed by isolating and culturing the fungus from infected tissues on potato dextrose agar or oatmeal agar.
