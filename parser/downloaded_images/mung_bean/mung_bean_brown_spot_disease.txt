Mung bean is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible seeds and sprouts1. Brown spot disease of mung bean can be caused by different pathogens, such as bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens) or fungi (e.g., Cercospora canescens)2 3 4 5.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus Cercospora canescens is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in structures called conidiophores4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of brown spot disease depend on the pathogen involved. For bacterial pathogens, the disease is usually seedborne and can be spread by rain splash, irrigation water, insects, or contaminated tools2 5. For fungal pathogens, the disease is usually airborne and can be spread by wind or rain4.
The period of disease onset for brown spot disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the pathogen involved. For bacterial pathogens, the disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but is more severe during warm and humid weather2 5. For fungal pathogens, the disease usually occurs during the later stages of plant growth, when the leaves are older and more susceptible4. The environmental conditions required for the disease also vary depending on the pathogen involved. For bacterial pathogens, the disease favors temperatures between 25В°C and 30В°C and high humidity2 5. For fungal pathogens, the disease favors temperatures between 20В°C and 30В°C and wet conditions4.
The overwintering method of the disease depends on the pathogen involved. For bacterial pathogens, the disease can survive on infected seeds or plant debris2 5. For fungal pathogens, the disease can survive on infected seeds, plant debris, or weeds4.
Using certified disease-free seeds or treating seeds with fungicides before planting.
Rotating crops with non-host plants for at least two years to reduce inoculum buildup in the soil.
Avoiding overhead irrigation and excessive nitrogen fertilization that favor disease development.
Removing or plowing under infected plant debris after harvest to reduce inoculum survival.
["Small water-soaked spots that develop into distinctive necrotic brown spots about 3-8mm in diameter, often with a narrow, diffuse yellow margin on leaves and stems1 2.", "The spots may enlarge, coalesce and fall out giving the leaves a tattered appearance1 2.", "Sunken brown spots can form on the pods1 2.", "If infection occurs early in pod development, the pod may become bent or twisted at the infection site1 2."]
["Black dots (pycnidia) on the spots, which contain spores (conidia) that are hyaline, cylindrical and septate1 2.", "The conidia are dispersed by wind or rain splash and germinate on wet plant surfaces3.", "The fungus penetrates the plant tissues through natural openings (stomata) or wounds and colonizes the intercellular spaces3.", "The fungus secretes enzymes and toxins that degrade the plant cell walls and membranes and cause necrosis3."]
