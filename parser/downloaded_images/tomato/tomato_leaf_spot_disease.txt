Tomato is a horticultural crop that is cultivated for its edible fruits1 2. Tomato leaf spot disease can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as fungi, bacteria, or viruses. Some of the common leaf spot diseases are Septoria leaf spot, early blight, bacterial spot, and tomato mosaic virus3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the type of fungus. For example, Septoria leaf spot and early blight are caused by fungi that produce conidia or asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or water5 . Bacterial spot is caused by a bacterium that reproduces by binary fission or cell division and is spread by rain, irrigation, insects, or infected seeds. Tomato mosaic virus is a virus that replicates inside the plant cells and is transmitted by mechanical contact, insects, or infected seeds. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of the disease also depend on the type of pathogen. For example, Septoria leaf spot and early blight are more prevalent in warm and humid weather and are transmitted by splashing water or wind6 . Bacterial spot is more common in hot and wet conditions and is transmitted by rain, irrigation, insects, or infected seeds. Tomato mosaic virus can occur in any weather and is transmitted by mechanical contact, insects, or infected seeds.
The period of disease onset for the disease varies depending on the type of pathogen and the environmental conditions. For example, Septoria leaf spot and early blight can appear as early as two weeks after planting or as late as mid-season5 . Bacterial spot can appear at any stage of plant growth but is more severe during warm and wet periods. Tomato mosaic virus can appear at any time during the growing season but is more likely to occur early in the season when plants are young and tender. The environmental conditions required for the disease are different for each type of pathogen. For example, Septoria leaf spot and early blight favor warm and humid weather with frequent rainfall or irrigation5 . Bacterial spot favors hot and wet weather with high humidity and rainfall. Tomato mosaic virus can occur in any weather but is more severe in cool and moist conditions.
The overwintering method of the disease depends on the type of pathogen. For example, Septoria leaf spot and early blight can overwinter on infected plant debris or weeds in the soil5 . Bacterial spots can overwinter on infected seeds or plant debris in the soil. Tomato mosaic virus can overwinter infected seeds or weeds in the soil.
Spraying fungicides such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper-based products to prevent or reduce the infection by fungal or bacterial pathogens1 2. Applying the fungicides according to the label instructions and recommended doses, frequencies, and timings1 2. Avoiding the use of systemic fungicides that can harm beneficial insects or pollinators3.
Removing and disposing of the infected leaves, stems, or fruits to prevent further spread of the disease1 2. Pruning the lower leaves to increase air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants1 2. Sanitizing the pruning tools and gloves after each use to avoid cross-contamination1 2.
Using bio fungicides such as Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to suppress the growth of fungal or bacterial pathogens4 5. Applying the bio fungicides according to the label instructions and recommended doses, frequencies, and timings4 5. Enhancing the natural enemies of the pathogens such as predatory mites or parasitic wasps by providing habitat and food sources3.
Using disease-resistant varieties of tomato plants1 2. Practicing crop rotation and avoiding planting tomato plants in the same area for at least two years1 2. Using certified seeds or transplants that are free of pathogens1 2. Mulching the soil to prevent soil splash and weed growth1 2. Watering the plants at the base and avoiding wetting the foliage1 2.
["Brown to black round spots with dark borders and beige centers on the lower leaves, moving up to the upper leaves as the disease progresses1 2.", "Yellowing, wilting, curling, or dropping of the infected leaves1 2.", "Dark spots with concentric rings on the stems or fruits1 2.", "Reduced plant growth and fruit yield1 2."]
["The presence of fungal spores or bacterial cells on the leaf spots, can be observed under a microscope or by using diagnostic kits.", "The detection of fungal or bacterial DNA or RNA by molecular techniques such as PCR or ELISA from plant samples."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of tomato leaf spot disease depends on the type of fungus and the variety of tomato. Some common fungal pathogens that cause leaf spot diseases are <em>Septoria lycopersici,</em> <em>Alternaria solani</em>, and <em>Stemphylium </em>spp. These fungi can develop resistance to fungicides over time, especially if the same fungicide is used repeatedly or at suboptimal doses1. The mechanism of resistance may involve changes in the fungal cell wall, membrane, or enzymes that reduce the uptake or efficacy of the fungicide1. The type and level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide mode of action and the fungal population1. Some tomato varieties have resistance genes that confer protection against certain leaf spot pathogens, such as the Sm gene that confers resistance to <em>Stemphylium</em> spp2. The mechanism of resistance may involve recognition of pathogen effectors and activation of defense responses in the plant2. A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of tomato leaf spot disease is to use a microscope to examine the infected leaf tissue for the presence of fungal structures, such as spores or fruiting bodies1. For example, <em>Septoria lycopersici</em> produces small black <em>pycnidia </em>(flask-shaped fruiting bodies) in the center of the leaf spots, which can be seen under a microscope1. Another quick test method is to use a lateral flow device (LFD) that detects fungal antigens or DNA in a sample1. This method is similar to a pregnancy test and can provide a positive or negative result within minutes1. However, this method requires specific LFDs for each fungal pathogen and may not be widely available1. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of tomato leaf spot disease involves the penetration of the fungal spores into the leaf tissue through natural openings (such as stomata) or wounds, and the colonization of the intercellular spaces by fungal hyphae 1. The fungi secrete various effectors that suppress plant immunity and facilitate infection1. Effectors are small molecules or proteins that can manipulate plant basal processes, such as hormone signaling, cell wall integrity, or defense gene expression1. The type and number of effectors may vary depending on the fungal species and strain1. For example, <em>Alternaria solani</em> produces at least 10 different effectors that target different plant components1. 
The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the compatibility between the fungal effectors and the plant receptors or resistance genes1. For example, some tomato varieties have resistance genes that recognize specific effectors from <em>Stemphylium</em> spp. and trigger defense responses that limit infection2.
