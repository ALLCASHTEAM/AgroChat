Tomato is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Solanaceae1. Tomato target spot is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Corynespora cassiicola2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of tomato target spot reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of tomato target spot are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and leaf wetness. The disease typically starts on the older, lower leaves in the inner canopy and then spreads to the upper leaves and fruits. The spores can survive on plant debris in the soil or on weed hosts and can be carried over from season to season5 3 4.
The period of disease onset for tomato target spot varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the tomato cultivar. The disease can appear at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during fruiting when the canopy is dense and humid2 3 4. The environmental conditions required for tomato target spot are temperatures of 68 to 82 Г‚В°F and leaf wetness periods as long as 16 hours. The disease is more severe in tropical and subtropical regions where these conditions are prevalent2 4.
The overwintering method of tomato target spot is by surviving on plant debris in the soil or on weed hosts that can serve as sources of inoculum for the next season2 3.
Fungicides can be applied to prevent or reduce the disease severity. The type of fungicide, application dose, application period, number of applications and control effect may vary depending on the product label, environmental conditions and disease pressure. Some examples of fungicides that have been reported to be effective against tomato target spot are azoxystrobin1, chlorothalonil2, mancozeb2, pyraclostrobin3, and fluopyram4.
Removing and destroying infected plant debris can reduce the inoculum source and prevent the disease from spreading. Pruning infected leaves and branches can also help to improve air circulation and reduce humidity in the canopy1 2 3.
There are some biological agents that have been tested for their antagonistic activity against tomato target spot, such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. However, their efficacy and availability may be limited by environmental factors, compatibility with other control methods, and cost.
Crop rotation with non-host plants can reduce the soil-borne inoculum of the pathogen. Avoiding planting tomatoes in areas where other susceptible crops or weeds have been grown can also prevent cross-infection. Planting resistant or tolerant varieties can reduce the disease impact. Avoiding overhead irrigation and watering in the morning can minimize leaf wetness duration. Applying mulch can prevent soil splash and fruit contact with the soil1 2 3 .
["Pinpoint-sized, water-soaked spots on the upper leaf surface that develop into small, necrotic lesions with light brown centers and dark margins1 2 3.", "Circular spots with concentric rings and a velvety black fungal lesion in the center on tomato fruit. The spots become pitted and larger as the fruit matures1 2 3.", "Yellow halos around the lesions on some varieties3.", "Lesions coalescing into large blighted areas on the leaflets and premature leaf drop1 2 3."]
["Gray to pale brown fungal mycelium growing on the surface of the lesions1 2 3.", "Dark brown to black fungal spores (conidia) produced in clusters (acervuli) on the mycelium1 2 3.", "Spore-bearing structures (pycnidia) embedded in the fruit lesions1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of tomato target spot, Corynespora cassiicola, is not well understood. However, some studies have suggested that the fungus may have different levels of sensitivity to fungicides, such as azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin1. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the cytochrome b gene or the target site of the fungicides1. Additionally, some strains of the fungus may have a wider host range than others, which could affect their resistance to different plant defenses1. No current tomato varieties are resistant to the disease2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of tomato target spot is to use a molecular technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). This method can detect the DNA of the fungus from infected plant tissues in less than an hour, without the need for expensive equipment or specialized skills. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of tomato target spot is also not well known. However, some studies have reported that the fungus produces several types of pathogenic effectors, such as proteases, lipases, and phytotoxins, that can degrade plant cell walls and membranes and cause necrosis . The fungus can also grow as an epiphyte on plant surfaces without causing symptoms, which may help it evade plant recognition and defense responses. The fungus can infect different parts of the tomato plant, including leaves, stems, and fruits1 3. The susceptibility of different plants may depend on their genetic background, environmental conditions, and stage of development. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of tomato target spot are not clear, as there is no evidence that bacteria are involved in this disease. However, if you meant to ask about the potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus, then one possible target could be a gene called CcPG1, which encodes a polygalacturonase enzyme that degrades plant cell walls and facilitates fungal infection. Knocking out this gene in the fungus reduced its virulence on tomato plants.
