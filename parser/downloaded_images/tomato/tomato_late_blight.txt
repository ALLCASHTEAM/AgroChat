Tomato is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruits1. Tomato late blight is caused by an oomycete pathogen called Phytophthora infestans1 2. Oomycetes are fungus-like organisms that are more closely related to algae than fungi2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic oomycete of tomato late blight is by producing sporangia, which are sac-like structures that contain many spores1 2. The sporangia can be dispersed by wind or water and germinate on the host plant under moist conditions1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of tomato late blight is airborne or waterborne3 1. The sporangia can travel long distances in the air or in rainwater and infect new plants when they land on wet leaves or stems4 1.
The period of disease onset for tomato late blight is usually in the late summer or early fall when the weather is cool and humid1 5. However, the disease can occur at any time of the year if the environmental conditions are favorable1. The environmental conditions required for tomato late blight are high humidity, low temperature, and free moisture on the plant surface1 5. The optimal temperature range for infection is between 15Г‚В°C and 25Г‚В°C, and the optimal relative humidity is above 90%1.
The overwintering method of tomato late blight is by surviving in infected plant debris, such as fallen fruits, leaves, or stems, or in alternative hosts, such as potatoes, petunias, or nightshades4 1. The pathogen can also overwinter in seed tubers of potatoes and infect new plants when they sprout1.
Crop rotation: Avoid planting tomatoes in the same location that tomatoes or potatoes were grown in the last two growing seasons1 2.
Resistant cultivars: Choose tomato varieties that are resistant to certain races of the late blight fungus3.
Sanitation: Remove any volunteer tomato and potato plants and nightshades that may harbor the pathogen3. Also, remove and destroy infected plant parts as soon as symptoms appear1.
Fungicides: Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease, following label instructions for dosage, frequency and safety precautions2 3. Some examples of fungicides that can be used for late blight are chlorothalonil, mancozeb, copper and mefenoxam2.
["Irregular to circular lesions on leaves, often with a lighter halo or ring around them. These lesions may appear water-soaked or dry out depending on the weather conditions2 4.", "White cottony growth on the underside of leaves and stems, indicating the presence of spores and mycelia of the fungus2 4.", "Browning, shriveling and dying of leaves and stems as the disease progresses2 4.", "Firm, dark, greasy-looking lesions on tomato fruits, which may become leathery and chocolate brown in color. These lesions can cover the entire fruit and cause it to rot2 4."]
["Sporangia of Phytophthora infestans, which are microscopic structures that contain spores and can be seen under a compound microscope2 4.", "Zoospores of Phytophthora infestans, which are motile spores that can swim in water and infect plant tissues. These spores can be detected by using a baiting technique with potato tuber slices4."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is actually an oomycete or water mold, called Phytophthora infestans1. It has a high level of genetic diversity and can evolve rapidly to overcome host resistance2. The mechanism of resistance involves the recognition of pathogen effectors by plant resistance (R) genes, which trigger a defense response2. The type of resistance agent depends on the specific R gene and effector combination. For example, some tomato cultivars have the R gene Ph-3, which confers resistance to some strains of P. infestans that produce the effector Avr3a2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a lateral flow device (LFD) that can detect P. infestans antigens from infected plant tissue2. This method is simple, rapid, and does not require specialized equipment or expertise2. Another method is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that can amplify P. infestans DNA from infected samples2. This method is more sensitive and specific than LFD, but requires more steps and equipment2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the production and dispersal of sporangia and zoospores by P. infestans3 2. Sporangia are spore-like structures that can germinate directly on the plant surface or release motile zoospores that can swim in water films and infect plant tissue through stomata or wounds3 2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary among different strains of P. infestans, but some common ones are RXLR and CRN effectors that can manipulate plant immunity and metabolism2. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility between the pathogen effectors and the plant R genes, as well as other factors such as environmental conditions, plant growth stage, and cultivar susceptibility2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well defined, as P. infestans is not a bacterium but an oomycete. However, some studies have identified some genes that are essential for P. infestans growth and virulence, such as PiGPB1, PiCesA3, PiCesA6, and PiCesA7, which are involved in cell wall biosynthesis2. Knocking out these genes could impair P. infestans infection and reduce disease severity2.
