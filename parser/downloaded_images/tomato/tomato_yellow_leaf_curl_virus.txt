Tomato is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruits1 2. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus is a viral disease caused by a DNA virus from the genus Begomovirus and the family Geminiviridae1 3.
The pathogenic agent of this disease is not a fungus, but a virus, so it does not have a mode of reproduction of a fungus. The virus replicates its DNA inside the host cell nucleus using the host machinery1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are insectborne, specifically by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, which can acquire and transmit the virus in a persistent-circulative manner1 3. The virus can also be transmitted through infected seeds4 5.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions, the whitefly population, and the susceptibility of the tomato cultivar. Generally, the symptoms appear within 10 to 15 days after infection3. The symptoms include yellowing and curling of the leaves, stunting of the plant, and reduced fruit yield and quality1 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and dry climates, which favor the multiplication and dispersal of the whitefly vector1 3. The optimal temperature range for the virus is 25 to 30 в„ѓ3. The virus can also infect other plant hosts such as eggplants, potatoes, tobacco, beans, and peppers1.
The overwintering method of this disease is through persistent infection of perennial hosts or weeds that serve as reservoirs for the virus and the whitefly vector1 3.
The use of insecticides to reduce the population of whiteflies that transmit the virus is one of the most common methods of control. However, this method has limitations such as insecticide resistance, environmental impact, and non-target effects. Some examples of insecticides that have been used against whiteflies are imidacloprid, acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, and spiromesifen1 2. The application dose, period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product, the crop, the climate, and the whitefly population.
The removal and destruction of infected plants or plant parts can reduce the source of inoculum and prevent further spread of the virus. However, this method is labor-intensive and may not be effective if the infection rate is high1 2. Another physical measure is the use of reflective mulches or nets that can repel or exclude whiteflies from the crop. These methods can reduce the incidence and severity of the disease, but they may also affect the microclimate and the growth of the plants1 2.
The use of natural enemies such as predators, parasitoids, or pathogens to control whiteflies is an environmentally friendly and sustainable method of control. However, this method requires a thorough knowledge of the biology and ecology of the whitefly and its natural enemies, as well as a careful monitoring and evaluation of their effectiveness. Some examples of natural enemies that have been used against whiteflies are Encarsia formosa, Eretmocerus eremicus, Orius spp., Chrysoperla spp., and Beauveria bassiana1 2.
The use of cultural practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, trap cropping, or sanitation can reduce the risk of infection and transmission of the virus. These practices can also enhance the natural resistance or tolerance of the plants to the virus. For example, crop rotation with non-host plants can break the life cycle of the whitefly and the virus; intercropping with repellent plants can deter whiteflies from colonizing the crop; trap cropping with attractive plants can divert whiteflies from the main crop; and sanitation can eliminate weeds or volunteer plants that can harbor whiteflies or the virus1 2.
["The most characteristic symptom of TYLCV infection is the upward curling and yellowing of young leaves. The leaf margins may also become purple or brown. The infected leaves may remain small and crumpled1 3.", "The infected plants may show stunted growth and reduced branching. The internodes may become shorter and the stems may become thinner1 3.", "The infected plants may produce fewer flowers and fruits. The flowers may drop prematurely or fail to set fruit. The fruits may be small, deformed, or discolored1 3."]
["The presence of whiteflies on the underside of leaves or on other plant parts is a sign of potential TYLCV infection. Whiteflies are small (about 1 mm long), yellowish insects with white wings that feed on plant sap1 3.", "The detection of TYLCV DNA in plant tissues using molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or hybridization is a definitive sign of TYLCV infection. However, these techniques require specialized equipment and expertise1 3.", "The observation of TYLCV particles or inclusion bodies in plant cells using electron microscopy is another definitive sign of TYLCV infection. However, this technique is also costly and time-consuming1 3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some studies have suggested that fungal endophytes may confer some resistance to TYLCV infection in tomato plants. The mechanism of resistance may involve induced systemic resistance, antimicrobial compounds, or interference with whitefly feeding. The level of resistance may vary depending on the type and strain of the endophyte, the environmental conditions, and the genetic background of the host plant.1 2 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not available, as far as I know. However, there are some methods for detecting TYLCV in tomato plants, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). These methods require specific reagents and equipment, and may take from a few hours to a few days to obtain results.3 4 5 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the inoculation of TYLCV by whiteflies into the phloem cells of tomato plants. The virus then replicates and moves systemically throughout the plant, causing symptoms such as yellowing, curling, and stunting of the leaves. The virus also affects the expression of host genes involved in defense, metabolism, and development. The virus encodes for six proteins that may act as pathogenic effectors to modulate host responses and facilitate infection. The type and number of these effectors may differ among different isolates of TYLCV. The infestation of different plants may also depend on the susceptibility or resistance of the plant species or cultivars, as well as the presence or absence of other viruses that may interact with TYLCV. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not clear, as TYLCV is not known to be associated with any bacterial pathogen. However, some studies have reported that TYLCV infection may increase the susceptibility of tomato plants to other bacterial diseases, such as bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum or bacterial speck caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. These bacteria may exploit the weakened defense system of TYLCV-infected plants and cause more severe symptoms and yield losses.
