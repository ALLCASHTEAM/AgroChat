Tomato is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Solanaceae1 2. Early blight is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria solani1 3 2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in chains2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of the disease are influenced by high humidity and temperatures above 75Г‚В°F4. The spores can be spread by wind, water, insects, and even on your clothes or shoes1.
The period of disease onset for early blight can vary depending on the environmental conditions and the cultivar of tomato, but it usually occurs at any time during the growing season1 3. The disease typically progresses from the bottom of the plant to the top1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid weather, as well as wet leaves1 3. The fungus also prefers acidic soil conditions5.
The overwintering method of the disease is by surviving in the soil, on plant debris, or on weed hosts1 3.
Control methods are the best way to prevent tomato blight from occurring. These methods include rotating your crops, spacing out plants to increase air circulation, add a six inch layer of mulch during the growing season to keep leaves from touching the soil1.
While cultural practices may help control tomato blights, fungicides are often needed. Apply fungicides (chlorothalonil, maneb, or copper-based fungicides) at 7 to 14 day intervals beginning 2 to 4 weeks after transplanting. Thorough coverage is essential2.
Organic treatments such as baking soda spray, compost tea, neem oil, and copper soap can also help reduce the severity of early blight3.
Selection of disease-resistant varieties; planting before the combination of land preparation and fertilization to improve field hygiene, timely removal of diseased leaves, stubs and diseased fruits, and centralized destruction; to strengthen the management of crop cultivation. Adequate base fertilizer, timely fertilizer, or the use of vegetable special fertilizer, so that the fruit is not out of fertilizer, to improve the host disease resistance. Reasonable dense planting, timely abduction, pruning and playing bottom leaves, conducive to ventilation and light. Protected land tomato focus on ecological control, control temperature and humidity. Open field tomato attention to timely drainage after the rain, remove fallen leaves, residual branches and diseased fruit, combined with good field hygiene. Heavily diseased fields to implement and non-tomato crops 2 to 3 years of crop rotation. Seeds with bacteria, with 52 в„ѓ warm soup soak seeds for 30 minutes.
["The most common symptom of early blight in both seedlings and mature tomato plants is small-ish brown spots developing on the lower leaves. The spots typically have concentric rings inside them that give a target or bullseye appearance, and are often surrounded with a light green or yellow halo4.", "As the disease progresses, the spots enlarge and coalesce, causing the leaves to turn yellow and wither. The disease usually starts from the bottom of the plant and moves upward3.", "The fruits may also develop dark, leathery spots with raised ridges and concentric rings at the stem end. Both green and ripe fruits can be affected3."]
["Early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani, which can produce spores on the infected plant parts. The spores are dark brown to black and can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope5.", "The spores can be spread by wind, water, insects, or contaminated tools. They can also overwinter in the soil or in plant debris3.", "The fungus can infect the plant through natural openings or wounds. It prefers warm and humid conditions for infection and growth5."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of tomato early blight, Alternaria solani, has developed resistance to several fungicides, such as benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, and QoIs1. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the target genes or overexpression of efflux pumps1. The level of resistance varies depending on the fungicide and the fungal population1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of tomato early blight is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay2. This method can detect the fungal DNA in plant samples within an hour using a simple device2. The LAMP assay is highly specific, sensitive, and cost-effective2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of tomato early blight is to produce necrotrophic effectors that induce cell death and tissue necrosis in the host plant. The fungus has at least 10 different effectors that can trigger plant immunity or susceptibility depending on the host genotype. The fungus can also infest other plants in the Solanaceae family, such as potato, eggplant, and pepper, but with different levels of aggressiveness. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of tomato early blight are not well known, as the disease is mainly caused by a fungus. However, some studies have suggested that genes involved in plant defense, such as NPR1, PR1, and WRKY33, may be important for resistance to Alternaria solani infection . Knocking out these genes may increase the susceptibility of the plant to the fungus .
