Tomato is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruits1. Tomato mosaic virus is a viral disease that belongs to the genus Tobamovirus2 3.
Tomato mosaic virus does not have a pathogenic fungus, but a pathogenic RNA molecule that encodes four proteins3. Therefore, it does not have a mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus. Tomato mosaic virus has an epidemiological pattern of being seedborne and mechanically transmitted by grafting, contaminated tools, workers, and plant debris4. It is not transmitted by insect vectors2. The mode of transmission is through small wounds on the plant caused by mechanical injury, insect chewing, or grafting1.
The period of disease onset for tomato mosaic virus depends on the environmental conditions, the strain of the virus, and the age and variety of the plant1. Generally, symptoms appear within 10 to 14 days after infection2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are not very specific, as tomato mosaic virus can infect plants in a wide range of temperatures and humidity levels2. However, some factors that may favor the disease are high nitrogen fertilization, high plant density, and low light intensity2. The soil conditions are not relevant for the disease, as it does not survive in the soil1.
Tomato mosaic virus does not have an overwintering method, as it does not survive outside living plant tissues1. However, it can persist in seeds, perennial weeds, and plant debris for up to two years1.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some studies have suggested that antifungal peptides derived from plants or animals may have potential to inhibit the growth of the fungus1. The mechanism of resistance may involve disrupting the fungal cell membrane or interfering with the fungal metabolism1. The level of resistance may depend on the type and concentration of the antifungal peptide, as well as the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect the fungal DNA in plant samples2. PCR is a technique that amplifies a specific region of DNA using primers and enzymes. PCR can be performed in a few hours and can be highly sensitive and specific2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is viral infection, which involves the entry, replication, movement, and transmission of the virus in plant cells3. The virus can enter plant cells through wounds or natural openings, such as stomata or plasmodesmata3. The virus can replicate in the cytoplasm using its own RNA-dependent RNA polymeras3. The virus can move within and between plant cells through plasmodesmata or vascular tissues3. The virus can be transmitted by mechanical contact, seed, or grafting3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors of the virus are viral proteins, such as coat protein, movement protein, replicase protein, and silencing suppressor protein4. These proteins can interfere with plant defense responses, such as RNA silencing, hormone signaling, and cell death4. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host range and host resistance of the virus and the plants4. Some plants may be susceptible to the virus, while others may be resistant or tolerant. Some plants may show symptoms of the disease, while others may be asymptomatic. Some plants may support viral replication and movement, while others may restrict them. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well known, but some studies have suggested that plant genes involved in defense responses or viral susceptibility may be candidates for knockout or mutation. For example, some genes that encode RNA silencing components, such as DCL, AGO, RDR, and SGS3, may be targeted by the bacteria to suppress plant immunity. Some genes that encode receptor-like kinases, such as FLS2 and EFR, may be targeted by the bacteria to modulate plant hormone signaling. Some genes that encode transcription factors, such as WRKY and MYB, may be targeted by the bacteria to regulate plant gene expression.
