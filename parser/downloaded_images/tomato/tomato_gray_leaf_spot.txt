Tomato is a horticultural crop1 2, which means it is grown for its edible fruits and not for its fibers, grains, or oil. Tomato gray leaf spot is a fungal disease3 1 2, which means it is caused by a fungus that infects the plant tissues and causes symptoms such as spots, blights, wilts, or rots.
The pathogenic fungus of tomato gray leaf spot is Stemphylium solani3 1 2, which reproduces by producing conidia2, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or water. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of tomato gray leaf spot are influenced by warm, moist conditions4 1 2. The fungus survives on plant debris, weeds, alternate hosts, or volunteer plants1. The conidia are spread by rain splash and wind3 1 and infect the leaves through natural openings or wounds2.
The period of disease onset for tomato gray leaf spot varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the tomato variety2. The disease can infect plants at any stage of their life3, but symptoms usually appear on older leaves first1. The disease can progress rapidly and cause severe defoliation and yield loss2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm temperatures (68-86Г‚В°F or 20-30Г‚В°C) and high humidity (above 85%)2. The fungus also prefers acidic soils (pH below 6.5) and low nitrogen levels2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on plant debris, especially tomato stems and leaves that are left in the field or in compost piles3 1. The fungus can also overwinter on weeds, such as nightshade plants, or alternate hosts, such as peppers, eggplants, potatoes, or gladiolas1.
Fungicides such as copper spray, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or maneb can be applied to prevent or reduce the infection1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the fungus2.
Infected leaves can be hand-picked and destroyed to prevent the spread of the fungus1 2. However, this may not be feasible for large-scale production or severe infection2.
A biofungicide such as Serenade can be used to suppress the fungus2. Serenade contains a beneficial bacterium called Bacillus subtilis that inhibits the growth of the pathogen2.
Crop rotation, seedbed sanitation, weed control, staking plants, mulching, avoiding overhead watering, and using resistant varieties are some of the cultural practices that can reduce the risk of infection1 2 3.
["Brown to black specks on older leaves, then newer growth2", "Gray center surrounded by a yellow halo on the spots2", "Leaves turn yellow, then brown, then drop2", "Center of the spot may fall out leaving holes2", "Entire plant may be affected and stunted2", "Fruit is not affected directly, but may suffer from sunscald due to defoliation2"]
["Presence of conidia (asexual spores) of Stemphylium solani on the leaf surface or in the lesions3", "Conidia are oval to cylindrical, hyaline to pale brown, and have one or more septa (cross-walls)3", "Conidia can be observed under a microscope or with a hand lens3"]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some possible factors are: The mechanism of resistance may involve the ability of the fungus to detoxify or degrade the fungicides, or to alter the target site or metabolic pathway of the fungicides1 2. The type of resistance agent may depend on the type of fungicide used, such as copper, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or maneb3. Some studies have reported reduced sensitivity of Stemphylium solani to copper and chlorothalonil1 2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the environmental conditions, the fungal population, and the frequency and dose of fungicide application1 2. Resistance may also be influenced by the presence of other pathogens or beneficial microbes1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is: Collecting leaf samples with typical symptoms of gray leaf spot4 Placing the samples in a moist chamber or a ziplock bag with wet paper towel overnight4 Examining the samples under a microscope or with a hand lens for the presence of conidia (asexual spores) of Stemphylium solani on the leaf surface or in the lesions4 Comparing the morphology and color of the conidia with reference images or descriptions4. Conidia are oval to cylindrical, hyaline to pale brown, and have one or more septa (cross-walls)4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but some possible aspects are: The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but they may include enzymes, toxins, or proteins that facilitate infection, colonization, or evasion of host defense1 2. 
The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host susceptibility, resistance genes, or defense responses1 2. Some tomato varieties have resistance to gray leaf spot conferred by a single gene (Sm) located on chromosome 111 2. The process of infestation may involve the following steps4: The conidia land on the leaf surface and germinate under moist conditions The germ tubes penetrate the leaf through natural openings or wounds. The hyphae grow inside the leaf tissue and form lesions. The fungus produces more conidia on the leaf surface or in the lesions. The conidia are dispersed by wind or water to new infection sites.
