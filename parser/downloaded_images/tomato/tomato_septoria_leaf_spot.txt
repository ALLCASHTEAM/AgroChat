Tomato is a horticultural crop that belongs to the Solanaceae family1. Septoria leaf spot is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici2 3 4.
The pathogenic fungus of this disease reproduces by producing conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by rain splash or wind2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by warm (60 to 80 F) and humid conditions, which favor the germination of conidia and infection of leaves5 2. The disease can also spread by contact with infected plant debris, solanaceous weeds, insects, people, or equipment1 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the inoculum level, but it usually occurs when plants are setting fruit3. Symptoms generally develop on the lower leaves first and then progress up the plant2 3 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm (60 to 80 F) and humid conditions, as well as wet foliage1 2. Soil conditions do not seem to have a significant effect on the disease2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected tomato debris and solanaceous weeds that serve as hosts for the fungus2 3.
Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate can help prevent the spreading of the disease1. However, fungicides should be applied before symptoms appear or as soon as they are noticed, and repeated every 7 to 10 days2. Some examples of fungicides that can be used are: copper hydroxide, copper sulfate, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, and azoxystrobin2 3. The application dose, period, number of applications and control effect may vary depending on the product label and the environmental conditions.
Removing infected leaves and stems can reduce the inoculum and slow down the disease progression1 2. However, this should be done carefully to avoid spreading the spores to healthy plants. Pruning tools and hands should be sanitized after handling infected plants. Infected plant debris should be disposed of or buried away from the garden2.
There is no known biological control agent for tomato septoria leaf spot2.
Crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops for at least two years can help reduce the inoculum in the soil2. Planting resistant or tolerant varieties can also help prevent or reduce the disease severity2 3. Some examples of resistant or tolerant varieties are: Mountain Fresh Plus, Mountain Supreme, Plum Dandy, Primo Red, and Sun Leaper3. Mulching can help prevent soil splash and weed growth that can harbor the fungus1 2. Spacing plants adequately and staking or caging them can improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves1 2. Watering plants at the base or using drip irrigation can avoid wetting the foliage and creating favorable conditions for the fungus1 2.
["Circular, tan to gray lesions on the lower leaves and stems of the plant. The lesions are typically small (\\2.", "The lesions generally have a dark-brown perimeter and a yellow halo may develop around the leaf lesions2.", "The symptoms usually occur in the older, lower leaves, but the disease can develop at any stage in the plant's life. They may also appear on the petioles, calyxes, and rarely on the fruits2.", "As the disease progresses, spots may coalesce and the leaves may become entirely blighted. The leaves may turn yellow and eventually dry out and fall off. This will weaken the plant, send it into decline, and cause sun scalding of the unprotected fruits. Without leaves, the plant will not continue producing and maturing fruits1."]
["Small dark spots in the center of the lesion. These are pycnidia, the fruiting body of the fungus where spores are produced. They can be seen with a magnifying lens as dark brown pimples1 2.", "On the underside of the leaves, spots may appear as a darker green color or вЂњwater-soakedвЂќ2."]
