Tomato is a horticultural crop that belongs to the Solanaceae family1. Tomato spot blight is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Alternaria solani2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of tomato spot blight reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that can be dispersed by wind or water4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of tomato spot blight are influenced by warm and humid weather, soilborne inoculum, infected plant debris, and overhead irrigation4. The disease can spread by airborne spores or splashed dirt from rain or watering2.
The period of disease onset for tomato spot blight varies depending on the environmental conditions and the cultivar of tomato, but it usually occurs after the plants begin to set fruit4. The first symptoms appear on the lower leaves near the ground as small brown spots with dark borders5. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, warm temperatures (between 20Г‚В°C and 26Г‚В°C), and frequent rainfall or dew formation4. The disease is more severe in soils with high nitrogen levels and low potassium levels4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in the soil or on infected plant debris that remains in the field or in compost piles4. The fungus can also overwinter on weeds or volunteer plants that belong to the Solanaceae family, such as potatoes, peppers, eggplants, or horsenettle2 4.
Insecticides can be used to reduce the population of thrips, the vectors of the virus. However, insecticides are not very effective in preventing the transmission of the virus, as thrips can infect plants within minutes of feeding. Insecticides should be applied only when thrips are detected and when virus symptoms are observed early in the season. Some examples of insecticides that can be used against thrips are spinosad, imidacloprid, and abamectin. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the local regulations. The control effect of insecticides is variable and may not prevent yield losses.
Infected plants or plant parts should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent further spread of the virus. Infected plants should not be composted or left in the field. Sanitation practices such as removing weeds, volunteer plants, and crop debris can also help reduce the sources of inoculum and thrips.
Natural enemies of thrips, such as predatory mites, lacewings, lady beetles, and parasitic wasps, can help suppress thrips populations and reduce the risk of virus transmission. However, biological control alone may not be sufficient to control tomato spotted wilt, and it may be affected by insecticide applications.
Cultural practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, reflective mulches, trap crops, and resistant varieties can help prevent or reduce tomato spotted wilt. Crop rotation with non-host crops can break the disease cycle and reduce the inoculum and thrips sources. Intercropping with non-host crops or repellent plants can also reduce thrips attraction and movement. Reflective mulches can repel thrips and delay virus infection

Resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: Tomato plants can resist tomato spotted wilt virus by recognizing the viral nucleocapsid protein (N) and activating a hypersensitive response (HR) that limits the virus spread1 2. The recognition is mediated by specific resistance genes in the plant genome that encode nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins1 2. The resistance genes that confer resistance to tomato spotted wilt virus are Sw-1a, Sw-1b, sw-2, sw-3, sw-4, Sw-5, Sw-6, and Sw-71 2. However, only Sw-5 exhibits a high level of resistance to the virus and has been widely used in breeding programs1 2. Sw-5 encodes an NLR protein that recognizes the N protein of the virus1 2. The level of resistance depends on the genotype of the plant and the strain of the virus. Sw-5 confers a high level of resistance to most strains of tomato spotted wilt virus, but some strains can overcome this resistance by mutating their N protein1 2. Other resistance genes, such as Sw-1a and Sw-1b, confer a moderate level of resistance that can delay but not prevent virus infection2. Some tomato cultivars may also have partial or quantitative resistance to tomato spotted wilt virus that is controlled by multiple genes3. 
Quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: One quick test method for detecting tomato spotted wilt virus is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies that bind to specific antigens of the virus4. ELISA can be performed on plant sap samples using commercial kits that provide colorimetric or fluorescent results4. ELISA is sensitive, specific, and relatively inexpensive, but it requires some laboratory equipment and skills4. Another quick test method for detecting tomato spotted wilt virus is immunochromatographic strip test (ICT), which uses lateral flow devices that capture viral antigens using antibodies coated on a membrane strip4. ICT can be performed on plant sap samples using disposable devices that provide visual results within minutes4. ICT is simple, rapid, and user-friendly, but it may be less sensitive and specific than ELISA[4] 
Mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease: Tomato spotted wilt virus infects plant cells by entering through wounds or natural openings created by thrips feeding5. The virus then uncoats its genome, which consists of three segments of single-stranded RNA (S, M, and L), and replicates using a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in the cytoplasm5. The viral RNA segments are encapsidated by the N protein to form nucleocapsids, which are assembled into spherical or pleomorphic virions with a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane5. 
Tomato spotted wilt virus encodes seven proteins: N (nucleocapsid), NSs (nonstructural suppressor of silencing), NSm (nonstructural movement), Gn and Gc (glycoproteins), RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), and NSS (nonstructural suppressor of apoptosis)5. These proteins are involved in different aspects of viral infection, such as replication, transcription, assembly, movement, transmission, and evasion of host defenses5. Tomato spotted wilt virus can infect different plants by adapting to different hosts and vectors. The virus has a high genetic diversity and can recombine or mutate its genome to generate new strains with different host ranges or virulence5. The virus can also modulate its gene expression or protein interactions to evade host recognition or resistance mechanisms5.
