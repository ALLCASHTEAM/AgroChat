Tomato is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruits1 2. Tomato leaf mold is a fungal disease that is caused by the pathogen Passalora fulva (previously called Fulvia fulva or Cladosporium fulvum)3 1 4 5 2.
The pathogen of tomato leaf mold reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that infect the lower surfaces of leaves3 2. The disease is transmitted by airborne spores that can spread from leaf to leaf and plant to plant by wind, rain/overhead irrigation, tools, workers and insects6 4 5. The disease is more common in greenhouse and high-tunnel tomatoes where the relative humidity is high (greater than 85%)1 4 5.
The period of disease onset for tomato leaf mold depends on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the tomato variety. In general, the disease can develop within 10 to 12 days after infection1. The oldest leaves are infected first1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high relative humidity (greater than 85%) and moderate to high temperatures (68-86Г‚В°F or 20-30Г‚В°C)3 1 4 5. The disease can also occur at lower humidity levels if the leaves remain wet for long periods1.
The overwintering method of this disease is through infected plant debris or in and on tomato seed. The pathogen can form dark, hard resting structures within infected plant debris that can produce new spores when exposed to air1. The pathogen can also survive on and in tomato seed and may be introduced to a new area by this route1 5.
There are several fungicides that can be used to treat tomato leaf mold, such as chlorothalonil, copper hydroxide, mancozeb, and azoxystrobin1 2. The application dose, period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product label and the environmental conditions. Always follow the label instructions and safety precautions when using any fungicide.
One physical measure to reduce tomato leaf mold is to remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest1 3. This can prevent the fungus from surviving and spreading to new plants. Another physical measure is to sanitize the greenhouse or high tunnel between crop seasons1 3. This can eliminate any spores or resting structures of the fungus that may remain on the surfaces of stakes, tools, walls, etc.
There is limited information on biological control of tomato leaf mold. One possible option is to use antagonistic microorganisms that can compete with or inhibit the growth of the fungus4. For example, some strains of Bacillus subtilis have been shown to have antifungal activity against tomato leaf mold4. However, more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of biological control agents for this disease.
There are several agricultural practices that can help prevent or reduce tomato leaf mold, such as: Using certified disease-free or treated seeds1 3. This can avoid introducing the fungus to a new area through infected seeds; Choosing resistant varieties1 3. Some tomato varieties have resistance to certain races of the fungus and can reduce disease severity and yield loss; Maintaining adequate ventilation and humidity1 3 2. This can reduce leaf wetness and lower the relative humidity below 85%, which are favorable conditions for the fungus to infect and spread; Avoiding overhead irrigation1 3 2. This can also reduce leaf wetness and spore dispersal by water splash; Staking and pruning plants1 3 2. This can increase air circulation and light penetration among the leaves, which can reduce humidity and fungal growth.
["The disease symptoms of tomato leaf mold are mainly visible on the leaves of the plant5 1 3 4. They include: Pale green to yellow spots on the upper side of the leaves, usually less than 1/4 inch in diameter, with no definite margins; Olive-green to brown velvety mold on the lower side of the leaves, below the spots; Leaf spots coalescing and turning brown as the disease progresses; Leaf curling, withering, and dying, but often remaining attached to the plant; In severe cases, the disease symptoms may also affect the flowers and fruits of the plant5 1 3 4. They include: Infected flowers turning black and falling off; Fruit infections starting as a smooth black irregular area on the stem end of the fruit; Infected fruit becoming sunken, dry, and leathery."]
["The disease signs of tomato leaf mold are the physical evidence of the fungus itself on the plant5 1 3 [5. They include: Conidia: These are asexual spores produced by the fungus on the lower surface of infected leaves. They are olive-green to brown in color and have a velvety appearance. They are easily dislodged by wind or water and can infect new leaves or plants; Sclerotia: These are dark, hard resting structures formed by the fungus within infected plant debris. They can survive for a long time in soil or on surfaces. They produce new conidia when exposed to air."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is Passalora fulva (syn. Cladosporium fulvum), which is an ascomycete fungus that lives on living tomato leaves1. It has several races that differ in their virulence and resistance to fungicides2. The mechanism of resistance is based on the interaction between the fungal avirulence (Avr) genes and the tomato resistance (Cf) genes2. The type of resistance agent depends on the fungicide used, such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, copper, or biological agents3 4. The level of resistance varies depending on the race of the fungus and the genotype of the tomato2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which can detect the DNA of P. fulva in less than an hour with high specificity and sensitivity. This method does not require expensive equipment or skilled personnel and can be performed in the field or greenhouse. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is based on the production of conidia that infect the lower surfaces of leaves through the stomata1. The fungus produces effector proteins that modulate the plant defense response and facilitate infection2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors depend on the race of the fungus and the Cf gene of the tomato2. Differences in infestation of different plants are determined by the compatibility or incompatibility between the Avr and Cf genes, which can result in either a hypersensitive reaction (HR) or a compatible interaction (CI)2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well known, as P. fulva is not a bacterial pathogen but a fungal one. However, some studies have identified knockout lethal genes in P. fulva that are essential for its growth and pathogenicity, such as genes involved in cell wall synthesis, ergosterol biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, and signal transduction. These genes could be potential targets for developing novel fungicides or genetic engineering strategies to control tomato leaf mold.
