Tomato is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Solanaceae1. Bacterial spot is a bacterial disease caused by four species of <em>Xanthomonas</em>: <em>Xanthomonas vesicatoria</em>, <em>Xanthomonas euvesicatoria</em>, <em>Xanthomonas gardneri</em>, and <em>Xanthomonas perforans</em>1 2.
The pathogenic bacteria of bacterial spot do not have a fungus or a mode of reproduction of a fungus. They are single-celled organisms that reproduce by binary fission3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of bacterial spot are influenced by warm (75Г‚В° to 86Г‚В°F), wet weather. The bacteria can enter plants through natural openings or wounds, and can be spread by wind driven rain, irrigation water, insects, tools, or human contact1 2.
The period of disease onset for bacterial spot depends on the environmental conditions and the inoculate level. Symptoms can appear as early as 7 to 10 days after infection under favorable conditions4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (75 в„‰ to 86 в„‰), high humidity, and rain. These conditions favor bacterial growth and infection1 2.
The overwintering method of this disease is through infected tomato debris, seeds, or volunteer plants. The bacteria can survive well in plant tissue, but poorly in soil1 2.
Copper-based products are the most commonly used fungicides for managing bacterial spot. However, copper-resistant strains of the bacteria have been reported in many regions, reducing the efficacy of copper applications. Other products that have shown some activity against bacterial spot include acibenzolar-S-methyl (Actigard), kasugamycin (Kasumin), oxytetracycline (Mycoshield), streptomycin (Agri-Mycin), and zinc-manganese-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Zn-Mn-EDTA) (Nordox). The application dose, period and number of applications may vary depending on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect of these products can range from 30% to 80%.
Infected plants or plant parts should be removed and destroyed to reduce the inoculum load and prevent further spread of the disease. Infected seeds should be discarded or treated with hot water or chlorine to kill the bacteria. Tools and equipment that come in contact with infected plants should be sanitized with bleach or alcohol to avoid cross-contamination.
Some beneficial microbes such as <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> (Serenade), <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> (BlightBan), and <em>Streptomyces lydicus</em> (Actinovate) have been reported to suppress bacterial spot by competing with or antagonizing the pathogenic bacteria. These microbes can be applied as foliar sprays or seed treatments to enhance plant resistance and reduce disease incidence.
Cultural practices such as crop rotation, weed control, mulching, stake and prune, irrigation management, and resistant varieties can help prevent or reduce bacterial spot. Crop rotation with non-host crops for at least two years can break the disease cycle and reduce inoculum buildup. Weed control can eliminate alternative hosts and improve air circulation. Mulching can prevent soil splash and reduce weed growth. Stake and prune can increase air flow and reduce leaf wetness. Irrigation management can avoid overhead watering and reduce humidity. Resistant varieties can tolerate or resist bacterial infection and limit disease development.
["On leaves: Small (less than ГўвЂ¦вЂє inch), circular, water-soaked spots that may be yellow-green at first but turn brownish-red as they age. The spots may coalesce and cause leaf yellowing, blighting and defoliation.", "On stems: Brown, elongated lesions that may girdle and kill stems.", "On fruits: Small, raised, blister-like spots that may have a yellow halo on green fruits. The spots become larger (up to Г‚Вј inch), brown, scabby and rough on mature fruits. The spots may be raised or sunken with raised edges."]
["The presence of bacterial cells on infected plant tissues. The bacteria can be observed under a microscope after staining with a dye such as lactophenol cotton blue or Gram's iodine.", "The presence of bacterial ooze on infected plant tissues. The ooze is a sticky, whitish substance that contains millions of bacterial cells. The ooze can be seen by squeezing infected tissues or by placing them in water."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of tomato bacterial spot disease is not relevant, because the disease is caused by bacteria, not fungi. The causal agents of tomato bacterial spot are<em> Xanthomonas perforans</em>, <em>Xanthomonas euvesicatoria</em>, <em>Xanthomonas vesicatoria</em>, and <em>Xanthomonas gardneri</em>1. These bacteria have developed resistance to some copper-based bactericides, which are commonly used to control the disease1. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the <em>copA</em> gene that encode a copper efflux pump, or the acquisition of plasmids that carry resistance genes1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the bacterial strain, the copper formulation, and the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of tomato bacterial spot disease is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique that can detect the specific DNA sequences of the bacteria from infected plant samples2. This method is more sensitive, specific, and rapid than conventional methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or PCR2. However, it requires specialized equipment and trained personnel to perform2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of tomato bacterial spot disease is complex and involves multiple factors. The bacteria enter the plant through natural openings (e.g., stomata or hydathodes) or wounds caused by insects, wind, or rain1. The bacteria then multiply and colonize the intercellular spaces of the leaf tissue, causing water-soaked lesions that later become necrotic and surrounded by yellow halos1. The bacteria may also secrete toxins, such as xanthomonadin and xanthan, that damage the plant cells and interfere with the photosynthesis and respiration processes1. The bacteria may also produce type III effectors that modulate the plant immune system and induce or suppress defense responses1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but some candidates have been identified, such as <em>XopA,</em> <em>XopD,</em> <em>XopE</em>, <em>XopJ</em>,<em> XopP</em>, and <em>AvrBsT</em>1. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host susceptibility, resistance genes, environmental factors and bacterial strains1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of tomato bacterial spot disease are mainly the plant cell wall and membrane components that are involved in signaling and defense pathways1. For example, some bacterial effectors target the plant <em>RIN4</em> protein, which is a negative regulator of plant immunity and a guard protein for several resistance genes1. Other effectors target the plant MAPK cascade, which is a key signaling pathway for plant defense responses1. The knockout lethal genes are unknown, but some candidates have been identified, such as <em>EDS1</em>, <em>PAD4</em>, <em>NPR1</em>, and <em>RPS2</em>, which are essential for plant basal or specific resistance against bacterial pathogens1.
