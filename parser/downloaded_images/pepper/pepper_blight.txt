Pepper blight affects pepper plants, which are horticultural crops grown for their fruits1 2. Pepper blight is caused by <em>Phytophthora capsici</em>, which is an oomycete or water mold1 2 3.
The pathogenic oomycete of pepper blight reproduces by producing sporangia and zoospores, which are mobile spores that can swim in water2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of pepper blight are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, soil type, and crop rotation. The disease can spread by soil splash, irrigation water, infested seeds, and contaminated tools4 2 3.
The period of disease onset for pepper blight varies depending on the plant stage and the type of infection. Seedlings can die shortly after emergence, while older plants can develop stem lesions, leaf spots, fruit rot, or root rot at any time during the growing season1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high moisture and high temperature (between 75 and 85 F or 23 and 29 C). The disease is more severe in poorly drained soils or in soils with high organic matter content1 2 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by forming oospores, which are thick-walled resting spores that can survive in the soil for several years2 3.
Fungicides such as mefenoxam, dimethomorph, mandipropamid, and fluopicolide can be applied to the soil or as foliar sprays to prevent or reduce infection by <em>Phytophthora capsici</em>, the causal agent of pepper blight1. The application dose, period, frequency, and effect may vary depending on the product label, environmental conditions, and disease severity.
Removing and destroying infected plants or plant parts can help reduce the spread of the disease. Avoiding overhead irrigation and improving soil drainage can also prevent excessive moisture and splashing of spores2.
Some beneficial microorganisms such as <em>Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus subtilis</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens </em>have been shown to inhibit the growth and sporulation of <em>Phytophthora capsici</em> <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo1</em>. These biocontrol agents can be applied to the soil or seeds before planting or as foliar sprays during the growing season.
Crop rotation with non-host plants such as brassicas or grains can reduce the inoculum level of <em>Phytophthora capsici</em> in the soil2. Planting resistant or tolerant pepper varieties can also help minimize disease losses3.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is: Mechanism of resistance: The fungus can develop resistance to fungicides by altering the target site, increasing the efflux of the fungicide, or degrading the fungicide1 2. The fungus can also overcome the host resistance by changing its virulence factors or producing new races1 2.Type of resistance agent: The fungus can be resistant to different classes of fungicides, such as phenylamides, QoI, cyanoacetamide-oxime, and SDHI1 2. The fungus can also be resistant to different sources of host resistance, such as Rpp1, Rpp3, and Rpp5 genes2. Level of resistance: The level of resistance can vary depending on the fungicide dose, the fungal isolate, and the environmental conditions1 2. The level of resistance can be measured by using methods such as EC50, RF, or ED502. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is: Isolation and identification: The fungus can be isolated from infected plant tissues and grown on selective media such as PARP or V8 agar1 3. The fungus can be identified by its morphology, such as the production of sporangia and zoospores1 3. Alternatively, molecular methods such as PCR or ELISA can be used to detect fungal DNA or antigens1 3.Resistance testing: The fungus can be tested for its resistance to fungicides or host resistance by using methods such as detached leaf assay, whole plant assay, or microtiter plate assay1 2. These methods involve exposing the fungus to different concentrations of fungicides or different sources of host resistance and measuring its growth or infection1 2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is: Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus produces several pathogenic effectors that can manipulate the host defense responses, such as RxLR, CRN, and NLP proteins2. These effectors can suppress the host immunity, induce cell death, or modulate host signaling pathways2. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus can infect different plants by recognizing their specific susceptibility factors, such as RBOH, PIP5K, and RIN4 proteins2. These factors are involved in regulating the host reactive oxygen species, calcium signaling, and R gene-mediated resistance2. The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are:
