Pepper is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Solanaceae1. Pepper Cladosporium grease(leaf)mold is caused by a virus called Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) that infects peppers and other crops1.
The virus is transmitted by thrips, which are small insects that feed on plant sap and carry the virus from one plant to another1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold are influenced by the presence and population of thrips, the availability and susceptibility of host plants, and the environmental conditions2. The disease can spread rapidly within a field or a greenhouse if thrips are abundant and uncontrolled1.
The period of disease onset for pepper stain disease depends on the time of infection by thrips. The symptoms usually appear 10 to 14 days after infection, but can be delayed or reduced if the infection occurs late in the season or under low temperatures1. The environmental conditions required for pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold are warm and humid, which favor the development and survival of thrips and the virus1. The optimal temperature range for TSWV infection is 20 to 25 в„ѓ, and high humidity (\&gt;80%) increases the risk of infection1.
The overwintering method of pepper stain disease is through weed hosts that harbor the virus and thrips during the off-season1. Some common weed hosts include chickweed, dandelion, sowthistle, lambsquarters, and nightshade1.
According to 1, some chemical agents that can be used to control pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold  are metalaxyl, dimethomorph, cymoxanil, propamocarb hydrochloride, and fluopicolide. The application dose, period, frequency, and effect may vary depending on the product and the environmental conditions. For example, metalaxyl can be applied at 0.25 g/L as a soil drench or foliar spray every 7-10 days with a control effect of 80-90%.
According to 2, one physical measure that can help prevent pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold  is to remove the infected parts of the plant as soon as possible to avoid spreading the disease. Another measure is to avoid wetting the leaves when watering, as water can facilitate the multiplication and dispersal of the pathogen.
According to 1, some biological agents that can be used to control pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold are <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em>, <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em>, and <em>Streptomyces sp</em>. These agents can inhibit the growth of the pathogen or induce resistance in the plant. The application dose, period, frequency, and effect may also vary depending on the product and the environmental conditions. For example, <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> can be applied at 1 g/L as a soil drench or foliar spray every 7-10 days with a control effect of 70-80%.
According to 2 and 3, some agricultural practices that can help control pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold  are crop rotation with non-host plants such as brassicas or grains for at least four years, increasing soil drainage by adding compost or planting on raised beds or mounds, using clean seeds and soil, and providing adequate fertilizer and irrigation.
["According to 2, pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold  can cause different symptoms depending on the part of the plant infected and the stage of growth. Some common symptoms are:", "Dark brown lesions near the soil line that girdle the stem and cause wilting and death of the plant.", "Dark green circular or irregular spots on the leaves that dry to a light tan color.", "Raised corky spots on the fruits that blacken and shrivel."]
["According to 4, pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold  is caused by a water mold called <em>Phytophthora capsici </em>that belongs to the same group as fungi but has some differences. Some signs of the pathogen on the plant are:", "White cottony growth on the underside of infected leaves or fruits.", "Sporangia (spore-producing structures) that are lemon-shaped and have a short stalk at one end.", "Oospores (thick-walled resting structures) that are spherical and have a smooth or warty surface."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of pepper fungal mildew, <em>Leveillula taurica</em>, has resistance to some fungicides, such as triazoles and strobilurins1. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the target site of the fungicides, such as the cytochrome P450 demethylase (CYP51) gene for triazoles and the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene for strobilurins1. The level of resistance varies depending on the fungal isolate and the fungicide concentration1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of pepper fungal mildew is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that can detect the fungal DNA in plant samples within an hour. The LAMP assay is based on the amplification of a specific region of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the fungal ribosomal DNA using four primers under isothermal conditions. The LAMP assay can be performed in a simple water bath or heating block and the results can be visualized by adding a fluorescent dye or observing turbidity. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold  is to produce haustoria, which are specialized structures that penetrate the plant cells and extract nutrients from them2. The fungus also produces conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or insects to infect new plants2. The fungus has different types of pathogenic effectors, which are molecules that modulate the plant immune response and facilitate infection. Some examples of pathogenic effectors are LtaE1, LtaE2, and LtaE3, which are secreted proteins that suppress plant defense genes and induce cell death. The fungus can infect different plants, but it shows different levels of host specificity depending on the plant species and cultivar2. Some plants are more resistant or tolerant to the fungus than others2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold  are not well known, but some studies have suggested that some genes may be involved in plant resistance or susceptibility to the fungus. For example, one study identified a knockout lethal gene called CaMLO2 in pepper that confers resistance to pepper cladosporium grease(leaf)mold  when mutated. CaMLO2 encodes a membrane protein that is required for haustorium formation by the fungus.
