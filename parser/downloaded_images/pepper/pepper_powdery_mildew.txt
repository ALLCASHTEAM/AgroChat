Pepper is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Solanaceae and the genus Capsicum. Powdery mildew of pepper is a fungal disease that is caused by the fungus Leveillula taurica1.
The mode of reproduction of Leveillula taurica is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in pycnidia (fruiting bodies) on the infected plant tissues1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of powdery mildew of pepper are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and irrigation. The disease is more prevalent in warm and dry regions, where the conidia can be easily dispersed by wind or splashing water. The conidia can also be transmitted by infected seeds, plant debris, or contaminated tools2 3.
The period of disease onset for powdery mildew of pepper varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the pepper cultivar. The disease can appear at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during the fruiting stage1 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30В°C) and low relative humidity (below 70%). The disease is also favored by frequent rainfall or overhead irrigation, which create wet conditions on the plant surface1 4 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris or seeds in the soil or on the ground. The fungus can also survive on alternative hosts, such as weeds or other solanaceous crops1
According to one source1, fungicides such as azoxystrobin, boscalid, chlorothalonil, difenoconazole, fluopyram, fluxapyroxad, iprodione, metconazole, penthiopyrad and pyraclostrobin can be effective against powdery mildew of pepper. The application dose, period, frequency and effect may vary depending on the product label and the environmental conditions. It is important to follow the label instructions carefully and rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
One possible physical measure is to cut off and dispose of the infected parts of the plant2. This can reduce the spread of the disease and improve air circulation around the remaining healthy foliage. However, this may not be feasible or practical in large-scale production or when the infection is widespread.
There are some biological agents that can suppress powdery mildew of pepper, such as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Trichoderma harzianum and Ampelomyces quisqualis3. These agents can compete with or parasitize the fungus, or induce systemic resistance in the plant. They can be applied as foliar sprays or soil drenches, alone or in combination with other control methods. Their efficacy may depend on the environmental conditions and the timing of application.
Some agricultural practices that can help prevent or reduce powdery mildew of pepper include2 3:Planting resistant or tolerant cultivars. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization. Watering at the base of the plant and avoiding overhead irrigation. Planting in full sun and spacing plants adequately. Removing weeds and crop debris that can harbor the fungus. Practicing crop rotation and intercropping with non-host plants.
["The disease symptoms of powdery mildew of pepper are1 2 3:Powdery-white fungal growth on the undersides of leaves. Light-green to yellow blotches on the upper leaf surfaces. Brown necrotic spots or patches on the leaves. Leaf curling, wilting and dropping. Reduced fruit size and quality."]
["The disease signs of powdery mildew of pepper are1 2 3:Conidiophores (fungal structures that produce spores) emerging from stomata (leaf pores) on the lower leaf surface. Conidia (fungal spores) forming chains at the tips of conidiophores. Cleistothecia (fungal structures that contain sexual spores) developing on older lesions."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease, Leveillula taurica, is influenced by several factors, such as the host plant genotype, the environmental conditions, and the fungicide application. Some studies have reported that the fungus can develop resistance to certain fungicides, such as azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin, by altering its target site or metabolic pathways. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal isolate and the fungicide dose. The mechanism of resistance is not fully understood, but some possible factors include reduced sensitivity of the cytochrome b gene, increased expression of efflux pumps, and enhanced detoxification enzymes. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a molecular technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). This method can detect the fungal DNA in plant samples within an hour, without the need for expensive equipment or skilled personnel. The LAMP assay can also differentiate between Leveillula taurica and other powdery mildew fungi, such as Oidium neolycopersici and Golovinomyces cichoracearum. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the penetration of the fungal hyphae into the plant cells through natural openings or wounds. The fungus then forms haustoria, which are specialized structures that absorb nutrients from the host cells. The fungus also secretes various effectors, which are molecules that modulate the plant immune system and facilitate infection. Some of the effectors identified in Leveillula taurica include a necrosis-inducing protein (NIP), a cerato-platanin protein (CP), and a small secreted cysteine-rich protein (SSCP). The type and number of effectors may vary depending on the host plant species and cultivar. For example, some pepper cultivars are more resistant to Leveillula taurica than others, due to their ability to recognize and respond to specific effectors. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well known, as there is limited research on this aspect. However, some studies have suggested that some genes involved in plant defense, such as salicylic acid (SA) signaling and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, may be important for pepper resistance to Leveillula taurica . Additionally, some genes related to cell wall biosynthesis and modification, such as pectin methylesterase (PME) and expansin (EXP), may also play a role in pepper susceptibility or tolerance to Leveillula taurica.
