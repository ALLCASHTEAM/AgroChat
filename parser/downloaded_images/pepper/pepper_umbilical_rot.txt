Pepper is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Solanaceae and the genus Capsicum. Umbilical rot of pepper is a bacterial disease that is caused by several species of bacteria, such as <em>Erwinia carotovora</em> subsp. carotovora, <em>Erwinia chrysanthemi</em>, Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Xanthomonas spp., and Cytophaga spp..
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic bacteria of this disease is by binary fission, which is a type of asexual reproduction where one bacterial cell divides into two identical cells. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of umbilical rot of pepper are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, irrigation, and soil pH. The disease is more prevalent in warm and moist regions, where the bacteria can multiply rapidly and infect the pepper fruits through wounds or natural openings. The bacteria can also be transmitted by infected seeds, plant debris, contaminated tools, overhead irrigation, or insect vectors.
The period of disease onset for umbilical rot of pepper varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the pepper cultivar. The disease can appear at any stage of fruit development, but it is more common during the ripening stage. The environmental conditions required for the disease spread are high temperature (25В°C вЂњ35В°C) and high relative humidity (above 80%). The disease is also favored by low soil pH (below 5.5), high nitrogen fertilization, frequent rainfall or overhead irrigation, and poor soil drainage.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris or seeds in the soil or on the ground. The bacteria can also survive on alternative hosts, such as weeds or other solanaceous crops.
According to one source1, blossom-end rot (BER) of pepper can be prevented by applying calcium nitrate or calcium chloride at 200-400 ppm through drip irrigation or as a foliar spray. The application should start at early fruit set and continue until harvest. The application dose, period, frequency and effect may vary depending on the product label and the environmental conditions. It is important to follow the label instructions carefully and rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
One possible physical measure is to remove and dispose of the infected fruits as soon as possible2. This can reduce the spread of the disease and prevent secondary infections by soft-rot bacteria or fungi. However, this may not be feasible or practical in large-scale production or when the infection is widespread.
There are some biological agents that can suppress BER of pepper, such as <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, <em>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</em>, <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em> and <em>Ampelomyces quisqualis</em>3. These agents can compete with or parasitize the pathogens or induce systemic resistance in the plant. They can be applied as foliar sprays or soil drenches, alone or in combination with other control methods. Their efficacy may depend on the environmental conditions and the timing of application.
Some agricultural practices that can help prevent or reduce BER of pepper include1 2 3:Planting resistant or tolerant cultivars. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, watering evenly and sufficiently to maintain soil moisture, planting in well-drained soil and avoiding waterlogging, removing weeds and crop debris that can harbor the pathogens, practicing crop rotation and intercropping with non-host plants
["The disease symptoms of umbilical rot of pepper are1 2: Sunken, brownish-black lesions on the blossom end of the fruits, Softening and collapsing of the affected tissues, Premature ripening and dropping of the fruits, Secondary infections by soft-rot bacteria or fungi."]
["The disease signs of umbilical rot of pepper are1 2: Fungal mycelium or spores on the surface or inside the lesions, Bacterial ooze or slime on the surface or inside the lesions."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease, mainly <em>Erwinia carotovora</em> subsp. carotovora and <em>Erwinia chrysanthemi</em>, is influenced by several factors, such as the host plant genotype, the environmental conditions, and the bactericide application. Some studies have reported that the bacteria can develop resistance to certain bactericides, such as copper and streptomycin, by acquiring plasmids or mutations that confer resistance. The level of resistance may vary depending on the bacterial strain and the bactericide dose. The mechanism of resistance is not fully understood, but some possible factors include reduced uptake of the bactericide, increased efflux of the bactericide, altered target site of the bactericide, and enhanced degradation of the bactericide. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is to use a molecular technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This method can detect the bacterial DNA in plant samples within a few hours, with high specificity and sensitivity. The PCR assay can also differentiate between <em>Erwinia carotovora</em> subsp. carotovora and <em>Erwinia chrysanthemi</em>, as well as other soft rot bacteria, such as Pseudomonas spp. and Xanthomonas spp. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the invasion of the bacterial cells into the plant tissues through natural openings or wounds. The bacteria then secrete various enzymes, such as pectinases, cellulases, and proteases, that rapidly breakdown cell walls and membranes. The bacteria also produce various toxins, such as coronatine and syringomycin, that inhibit plant defense responses and cause tissue necrosis. The type and number of enzymes and toxins may vary depending on the host plant species and cultivar. For example, some pepper cultivars are more resistant to <em>Erwinia carotovora</em> subsp. carotovora than others, due to their ability to produce phenolic compounds that inhibit bacterial growth. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well known, as there is limited research on this aspect. However, some studies have suggested that some genes involved in plant defense, such as salicylic acid (SA) signaling and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, may be important for pepper resistance to <em>Erwinia carotovora</em> subsp. carotovora . Additionally, some genes related to cell wall biosynthesis and modification, such as pectin methylesterase (PME) and expansin (EXP), may also play a role in pepper susceptibility or tolerance to <em>Erwinia carotovora</em> subsp. carotovora.
