Pepper is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Solanaceae1. Pepper virus disease is caused by various types of viruses that infect pepper plants and reduce their yield and quality1. Some of the most common pepper viruses are cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), tobacco etch virus (TEV), tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), alfalfa mosaic virus (AMY), and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV)2 3.
Viruses do not have a mode of reproduction by themselves, but they rely on the host cells to replicate their genetic material and produce new virus particles. The pathogenic viruses of pepper disease are mostly RNA viruses that have a single-stranded or double-stranded RNA genome2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of pepper virus disease vary depending on the type of virus and the environmental conditions. Most pepper viruses are spread by aphids or thrips in a nonpersistent or persistent manner, respectively1 2. Some viruses can also be transmitted by mechanical contact, such as through tools, hands, or plant debris1 2. Some viruses can also be transmitted through infected seeds or grafts1 2.
The period of disease onset for pepper virus disease depends on the time of infection and the type of virus. Generally, the earlier the infection occurs, the more severe the symptoms and the greater the yield loss1. Some viruses, such as CMV and TMV, can cause symptoms within a few days or weeks after infection, while others, such as TEV and TSWV, can take several weeks or months to show symptoms2. The environmental conditions required for the disease depend on the type of virus and the vector involved. Generally, pepper virus disease is more prevalent in warm and humid climates, where aphids and thrips can thrive and multiply.
Pathogens can overwinter in living plants, as well as in soil or diseased bodies within the soil, and can also overwinter in the flesh attached to seeds.
There is no effective chemical control for virus diseases of pepper. However, some insecticides can be used to reduce the population of aphids, which are the main vectors of some viruses such as CMV and TSWV1. Some examples of insecticides are imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, pymetrozine, and flonicamid2. The application dose, period, frequency, and effect of these insecticides depend on the product label and the local regulations.
Infected plants or plant parts should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent further spread of the virus. Rogueing should be done before flowering or fruiting to avoid attracting aphids1. Infected plants should not be composted or left in the field2.
There are some natural enemies of aphids that can help reduce their population and transmission of viruses. These include ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps, and entomopathogenic fungi2. However, biological control alone may not be sufficient to prevent virus infection, especially in high-risk areas1.
The most effective way to prevent virus diseases of pepper is to use resistant or tolerant varieties. Some pepper varieties have resistance to CMV, TMV, TEV, TSWV, or PVY1 2. Crop rotation with non-host plants can also help reduce the inoculum source of some viruses. Avoid planting peppers near other solanaceous crops such as tomato, eggplant, or tobacco that may harbor viruses2. Use certified virus-free seeds or transplants and avoid mechanical transmission of viruses by tools or hands1 2.
["CMV: The symptoms of CMV infection vary depending on the strain of the virus, the age of the plant, and the environmental conditions. Some common symptoms are ring-spot or oak-leaf necrotic patterns on lower leaves (fig. 1), mosaic or mottling on upper leaves (fig. 3), stunting, distortion, and malformation of leaves, flowers, and fruits (fig. 2), and reduced yield and quality1.", "TMV: The symptoms of TMV infection include mosaic or mottling on leaves, stunting, leaf curling or rolling, necrotic spots on stems and petioles, and fruit deformation2.", "TEV: The symptoms of TEV infection include mosaic or mottling on leaves, leaf curling or crinkling, vein clearing or banding, stunting, flower abortion or sterility, and fruit deformation2.", "TSWV: The symptoms of TSWV infection include necrotic spots or rings on leaves, stems, and fruits (fig. 4), mosaic or mottling on leaves, stunting, wilting, and reduced yield and quality2.", "AMY: The symptoms of AMY infection include mosaic or mottling on leaves, yellowing or chlorosis on leaf margins or veins (fig. 5), stunting, flower abortion or sterility, and fruit deformation2.", "PMMoV: The symptoms of PMMoV infection include mild mosaic or mottling on leaves (fig. 6), stunting, reduced yield and quality3."]
["CMV: There are no visible signs of CMV on pepper plants. The virus can only be detected by serological or molecular tests1.", "TMV: There are no visible signs of TMV on pepper plants. The virus can only be detected by serological or molecular tests2.", "TEV: There are no visible signs of TEV on pepper plants. The virus can only be detected by serological or molecular tests2.", "TSWV: There are no visible signs of TSWV on pepper plants. The virus can only be detected by serological or molecular tests2.", "AMY: There are no visible signs of AMY on pepper plants. The virus can only be detected by serological or molecular tests2.", "PMMoV: There are no visible signs of PMMoV on pepper plants."]
The resistance obtained by introducing the gene of Plant virus into the recipient plant is called pathogen derived resistance. It includes virus resistance mediated by Plant virus coat protein (CP) gene, virus replicase gene, virus satellite RNA, virus movement protein (MP) gene, ribozyme (Rz), virus Antisense RNA and defective interfering RNAs (DI RNAs).
The detection methods of Plant virus can be divided into direct method and indirect methodDirect method refers to the method of directly observing whether there is a virus in the sample, which is the electron microscope negative staining observation method. The advantage of this method is that it is simple and fast, and virus particles can be directly observed, which can be roughly qualitatively determined, and then roughly quantified based on the amount of virus in one field of view; The disadvantage is that the cost is too high.Indirect method is a method of indirectly proving whether there is a virus in a sample. According to the detection principle, it can be divided into serological detection method and molecular biology detection method. Serological detection methods are a series of detection methods based on the principle of specific reactions between viruses and antibodies, including ELISA, Western, and test strip detection methods; Molecular biology detection is a detection method based on PCR technology, which extracts the nucleic acid of the test sample and amplifies specific virus genes using specific primers to prove whether the tested sample contains viruses. The advantages of serological testing method are simplicity, speed, more accurate qualitative analysis than negative staining observation method, and lower cost. The disadvantage is that it is difficult to set up a control and is prone to false positives or negative results. The advantages of molecular biology detection methods are the most accurate qualitative analysis, high cost, and long detection cycle.
Plant virus invade cells through small wounds or natural pores on plant cell walls, or plasmodesmata between plant cells, or through mouthparts and haustoris of mediators.
Here are some potential targets for these viruses:RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp): This is an essential enzyme for replication of CMV, TMV, and CaMV. Therefore, RdRp is a potential target for these viruses. Studying the structure and function of RdRp can help in developing antiviral drugs targeting these viruses.Proteases: Some proteases in these viruses play crucial roles in virus replication and infection. For example, proteases NIa and NIb in TMV are involved in RNA replication and translation, respectively. Therefore, these proteases are also potential targets for these viruses.Viral capsid proteins: The capsid proteins of these viruses determine their infectivity and immunogenicity. Therefore, these proteins are also potential targets. Researching the structure and function of these proteins can help in developing vaccines and antibodies to prevent these viruses from infecting plants.
