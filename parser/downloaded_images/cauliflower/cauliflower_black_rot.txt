Cauliflower is a type of horticultural crop that belongs to the cruciferous family of vegetables1. Black rot is a type of bacterial disease that affects cruciferous vegetables such as cauliflower1 2. The causal agent is Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc)1 2.
The mode of reproduction of Xcc is by binary fission, which means it divides into two identical cells3. Xcc does not produce spores or conidia3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of black rot are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall4 2. Xcc can be introduced into a garden on or in seeds and transplants of susceptible vegetables1 2. It can also survive in plant residues or on weed hosts1 2. Xcc can spread in the field by water (rain, irrigation), insects, equipment, and animals1 2. Xcc can enter susceptible plants through roots, natural openings in leaves (hydathodes) or wounds made by tools, rough handling, or insect feeding1 2.
The period of time during which the disease occurs depends on the environmental conditions and the stage of plant growth1 2. Black rot symptoms may not develop for more than a month after cruciferous vegetables start to grow1. Initial symptoms are irregular, dull, yellow blotches that appear on the edges of leaves1 2. As the disease progresses, these blotches expand into V-shaped areas with the wide part of the вЂњVвЂќ at the edge of the leaf and the point of the вЂњVвЂќ toward the attachment point of the leaf to the plant1 2. The V-shaped areas are initially yellow, but eventually become brown and necrotic (i.e., dead) in the center with a yellow border or halo1 2. Veins in affected areas are brown or black, forming to a net-like pattern (often most visible when leaves are held up to the light)1 2. Later, interior stem tissue (specifically the water conducting tissue) will also turn brown or black1 2. At this point, affected plants tend to show symptoms of wilting1 2. Black rot can also predispose vegetables to other rot diseases such as bacterial soft rot1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm temperatures (approximately 80В°F) and high humidity1 2. These conditions favor the growth and spread of Xcc. Optimum temperatures for development are 80В°F to 86В°F2. Water in the form of dew, rain, or sprinkler irrigation is necessary for spread2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in plant refuse for up to 2 years and being carried internally and externally on seed1 2. Xcc can also overwinter on cruciferous weeds such as shepherdвЂ™s purse and wild mustard1.
Copper-containing fungicides that are labeled for use on cruciferous vegetables may help limit additional disease development1. Actigard, a plant activator that induces host-resistance pathways, can suppress the development of black rot by 0.5 to 1 oz/A every 7 days for up to four applications per season2.
Infected leaves and spotted florets can be discarded or trimmed3. Hot water seed treatment of 122В°F for 30 minutes can clean contaminated seed2.
No effective biological control agents have been reported for this disease.
Use clean, pathogen-free seed from Western States2. Use a 2- to 3-year rotation out of crucifers in production fields and transplant beds2. Control cruciferous weeds and insect pests2. Use resistant or tolerant varieties of cabbage such as Bobcat, Defender, Guardian, King Cole, Roundup, Superdane, Superkraut, Titanic 902 1.

["The physical evidence of the pathogen itself on the plant is difficult to observe without a microscope. However, some signs that may indicate the presence of the bacterium are:", "A yellowish ooze that exudes from infected tissues when cut and squeezed4.", "A black discoloration in the stem when it is split lengthwise4.", "A bacterial streaming test that involves placing a small piece of infected tissue in water and observing a milky cloud of bacteria coming out of it under a microscope4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is mainly based on the host plant genotype and the temperature1 2. Some cabbage varieties have been rated for tolerance to black rot in a recent study at Cornell University1. The A type resistance is resistant at all temperatures, whereas the B type resistance exhibits resistance only up to 77В° F, above which plants will become infected3. The mechanism of resistance is not fully understood, but it may involve plant defense responses such as hypersensitive reaction, production of antimicrobial compounds, and induction of systemic acquired resistance4. 
A quick test for the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is by using a bacterial streaming test. This test involves cutting a small piece of infected tissue and placing it in a drop of water on a microscope slide. The slide is then examined under a microscope for the presence of bacterial cells streaming out of the tissue. Alternatively, a PCR-based test can be used to detect and identify Xcc from plant samples. 
The mechanism of infestation by the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is by injecting effector proteins into the plant cells through a type III secretion system. These effectors can modulate plant immunity, alter plant metabolism, and promote bacterial colonization and survival. Xcc can produce different types and numbers of effectors depending on the host plant and the environmental conditions. Some effectors are conserved among different Xcc strains, while others are specific to certain races or pathovars. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the compatibility or incompatibility between the effectors and the plant resistance genes. 
Potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease are genes involved in plant defense signaling, such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) pathways. Knockout or silencing of these genes can compromise plant resistance to Xcc and increase susceptibility. For example, knockout of NPR1, a key regulator of SA-mediated defense, resulted in increased disease severity and bacterial growth in Arabidopsis thaliana infected with Xcc. Similarly, silencing of EIN2, a central component of ET signaling, led to enhanced susceptibility to Xcc in Brassica oleracea.
