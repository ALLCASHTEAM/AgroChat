Cauliflower is a horticultural crop that belongs to the Brassica family. It is grown for its edible white head or curd that is harvested before flowering1. Downy mildew of cauliflower is an oomycete disease that is caused by Hyaloperonospora parasitica1 2. Oomycetes are fungus-like organisms that are also known as water molds3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic oomycete of the disease is by spores that are carried by the wind and germinate in wet environments1. The spores are produced in structures called sporangia that are visible as furry gray mold on the lower leaf surface2. The sporangia can either release zoospores (mobile spores) that swim in water or germinate directly into hyphae (filaments) that infect the plant tissue3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of the disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind. The disease is more prevalent in cool (below 75В°F) and wet weather, when the spores can easily germinate and infect the plant through natural openings or wounds4. The disease can also spread through contaminated seed or seedlings, or through cruciferous weeds that serve as hosts for the oomycete2. The disease can affect both seedlings and mature plants, but is more severe on older leaves2.
The period of time during which the disease occurs depends on the climatic conditions and the susceptibility of the cauliflower variety. The disease can occur at any time of the season, but is more likely to occur in spring and fall when the temperatures are cool and moist2. Some varieties of cauliflower are resistant or tolerant to downy mildew, while others are susceptible and may show symptoms within a few days of infection2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity (above 90%), wetness (dew, rain, irrigation), and cool temperatures (between 58 and 72В°F)1 2. These conditions favor the production and germination of spores, as well as the infection and colonization of the plant tissue by the oomycete2. The disease is less likely to occur in hot and dry weather, or when the leaves are kept dry2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in plant debris or on weed hosts for up to two years2. The oomycete can also overwinter as oospores (thick-walled spores) in the soil or on infected seed3. These oospores can germinate and produce sporangia when conditions are favorable for infection3.
According to 1, fungicides such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and copper can be used to prevent or reduce downy mildew infection on cauliflower. The application dose, period, frequency, and effectiveness of these fungicides may vary depending on the product label, weather conditions, disease severity, and crop stage. Always follow the label instructions and safety precautions when using any pesticide.
According to 2, infected parts of the plant should be removed and destroyed to prevent further spread of the disease. Avoid overhead irrigation and water early in the day to allow the foliage to dry quickly. Increase the spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
According to 1, some biological agents such as Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces lydicus may have some suppressive effect on downy mildew, but their efficacy is not consistent or reliable. More research is needed to evaluate their potential as biocontrol agents for this disease.
According to 3 4 1, crop rotation, resistant varieties, and sanitation are important cultural practices to prevent or reduce downy mildew infection on cauliflower. Rotate crops with non-host plants for at least two years to reduce the inoculum in the soil. Choose varieties that have resistance or tolerance to downy mildew, such as 'Snow Crown', 'Snowball Y', 'Candid Charm', and 'White Sails'. Remove and destroy any crop debris, volunteer plants, or weeds that may harbor the pathogen.
["According to 2 3 4 1 5, the symptoms of downy mildew on cauliflower include yellow spots on the upper leaf surfaces and gray mold on the lower leaf surfaces. The spots may coalesce and turn brown or necrotic, causing the leaves to wither and die. The mold may produce spores that can be dispersed by wind or water. The disease can also affect the cauliflower heads, causing dark brown internal streaks or rots."]
["According to 2 3 4 1 5, the signs of downy mildew on cauliflower are the presence of gray mold or white fluffy growth on the lower leaf surfaces or on the infected heads. The mold is composed of mycelium and sporangia of the pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica (also known as Peronospora parasitica), an oomycete that belongs to a different group of organisms than fungi. The sporangia are oval-shaped structures that contain zoospores, which are motile spores that can swim in water and infect new hosts."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of cauliflower downy mildew is Hyaloperonospora parasitica1 2, which is an obligate parasite that needs live plants to grow and reproduce1. It can survive on crop and weed hosts in some areas and may survive as spores in infested crop debris1. The fungus can detoxify plant glucosinolate hydrolysis products, which are toxic to many pathogens, via an isothiocyanate hydrolase that converts isothiocyanates into harmless amines3. This enzyme may confer resistance to the fungus against the plant's chemical defense3. 
A quick test for the phytopathogenic fungus of cauliflower downy mildew is to examine the lower leaf surface of infected plants for a gray mold that consists of fungal spores2 1. The upper leaf surface may show yellow, brown or necrotic spots4 2 1. The fungus may also cause dark brown internal streaks on the cauliflower head5. 
The mechanism of infestation by the phytopathogenic fungus of cauliflower downy mildew is that the fungal spores are carried by the wind and germinate in wet environments with temperatures between 58 and 72В°F4. The fungus enters the plant through wounds and natural openings and colonizes the intercellular spaces of the plant tissues3. The fungus produces haustoria, which are specialized structures that penetrate the plant cells and extract nutrients from them3. The fungus also secretes effector proteins that modulate the plant's immune response and facilitate infection3. The number and type of effectors may vary depending on the host plant and the fungal isolate3. 
Potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of cauliflower downy mildew are not clear from the available information. However, some studies have suggested that disrupting the function of the isothiocyanate hydrolase or some of the effector proteins may reduce the virulence of the fungus and enhance the resistance of the plant3.
