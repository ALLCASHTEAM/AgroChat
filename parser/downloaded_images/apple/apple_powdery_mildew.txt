Apple is a type of horticultural crop, which means it is grown for its fruits, flowers, or ornamental value1. Apple powdery mildew is a type of fungal disease, caused by the fungus Podosphaera leucotricha2 3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that can be spread by wind to initiate new infections2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are airborne, as the conidia can be dispersed by wind over long distances and infect new shoots, leaves, blossoms, and fruit5 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease is in the spring, when the infected buds open and release conidia that infect new growth2 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are mild and dry weather, with temperatures between 66В°F and 71В°F and relative humidity above 70 percent2 4. Wetness is not required for infection to occur2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in infected buds that were formed during the previous season2 4.
Fungicides that are effective against powdery mildew include sterol inhibitors (such as myclobutanil and fenbuconazole), strobilurins (such as trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin), and potassium bicarbonate1 2. These fungicides should be applied at the tight bud stage and repeated until the new shoot growth stops3 4. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease pressure. The control effect can vary depending on the cultivar susceptibility, the environmental conditions, and the resistance management1 3 2.
Pruning and removing infected shoots and buds can help reduce the inoculum and improve air circulation1 3 4. Burning or burying the pruned material can prevent further spread of the disease4.
There are some biological agents that can suppress powdery mildew, such as Bacillus subtilis, Ampelomyces quisqualis, and Trichoderma harzianum. However, their efficacy and availability may be limited compared to chemical fungicides.
Planting resistant cultivars, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, and maintaining optimal irrigation can help reduce the susceptibility and severity of powdery mildew1 3 4.

The mechanism of resistance is mainly based on mutations in the target genes of fungicides, such as sterol biosynthesis genes for sterol inhibitors and cytochrome b gene for strobilurins1 2 3. The type of resistance agent is either qualitative or quantitative, depending on the mode of action and specificity of the fungicide1 2 3. Qualitative resistance is conferred by a single mutation that renders the fungicide ineffective, whereas quantitative resistance is conferred by multiple mutations that reduce the fungicide sensitivity1 2 3. The level of resistance is measured by the effective concentration (EC) or effective dose (ED) of the fungicide that inhibits 50% of the fungal growth or spore germination1 2 3. The level of resistance can vary from low to high depending on the fungicide class and the fungal population1 2 3. 
A molecular diagnostic method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that can detect and identify the fungal DNA from infected plant tissues or spores4 5. This method can also be used to screen for fungicide resistance by amplifying and sequencing the target genes1 2 3. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors are not well known for Podosphaera leucotricha, but some studies have suggested that it may secrete proteases, lipases, and cutinases to degrade the plant cuticle and cell wall6 . It may also produce toxins, enzymes, and elicitors to interfere with the plant defense responses6 . The differences in infestation of different plants are mainly determined by the host specificity and compatibility of the fungus and the plant6 . Some factors that influence the host range and infection process are the recognition and attachment of spores, the penetration and colonization of hyphae, and the evasion and suppression of plant immunity6 . 
I do not have enough information to answer this question. However, some studies have suggested that some genes involved in cell wall synthesis, signal transduction, stress response, and metabolism may be essential for fungal growth and pathogenicity . These genes could be potential targets for developing novel fungicides or enhancing host resistance.
