Apple is a type of horticultural crop1, which means it is grown for its fruits, flowers, or ornamental value. Apple brown spot disease can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as fungi, bacteria, or water molds. Some examples are apple scab2 3, black rot4, and Acremonium brown spot1. Apple scab and black rot are fungal diseases, while Acremonium brown spot is caused by a water mold.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of apple brown spot disease depends on the type of fungus. For example, apple scab fungus reproduces by producing spores called conidia2 3, while black rot fungus reproduces by producing spores called ascospores4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of apple brown spot disease also depend on the type of pathogen. For example, apple scab spores are dispersed by wind, rain, or irrigation to infect new leaves, flowers, or fruits5 3, while black rot spores are dispersed by wind or rain to infect wounds or pruning cuts on branches or fruits4. Acremonium brown spot occurs on bagged apple fruits and is transmitted by contact with infected bags or soil1.
The period of disease onset for apple brown spot disease varies depending on the type of pathogen and the environmental conditions. For example, apple scab infection can occur any time during the growing season, but is most severe in spring when the weather is warm and wet2 3, while black rot infection can occur from bloom to harvest, but is most severe in late summer when the weather is hot and humid4. Acremonium brown spot infection can occur from bagging to harvest, but is most severe in autumn when the temperature is between 15 and 25В°C and the relative humidity is above 80%1. The environmental conditions required for apple brown spot disease depend on the type of pathogen and the host susceptibility. For example, apple scab requires several hours of leaf wetness and temperatures around 70Г‚В°F for spore germination and infection2 3, while black rot requires wounds or pruning cuts for infection and temperatures between 75 and 85В°C for spore production4. Acremonium brown spot requires high humidity and moderate temperature for infection and disease development1.
The overwintering method of apple brown spot disease depends on the type of pathogen and its survival structures. For example, apple scab overwinters in diseased leaves on the ground that produce spores in spring2 3, while black rot overwinters in cankers or mummified fruits that produce spores in spring or summer4. Acremonium brown spot overwinters in infected bags or soil that produce spores in autumn or winter1.
This involves applying fungicides or bactericides to prevent or reduce the infection. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect vary depending on the product and the disease. For example, for apple scab, some recommended fungicides are captan, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, myclobutanil, propiconazole, and thiophanate-methyl1 2. These should be applied before or during the primary infection period in spring, and repeated every seven to 10 days until dry weather1 2. For black rot, some recommended fungicides are captan, mancozeb, thiophanate-methyl, and ziram3. These should be applied at pink bud stage, petal fall stage, and every two weeks until harvest3. For Acremonium brown spot, no specific fungicide is reported, but some general fungicides for water molds are mefenoxam, metalaxyl, fosetyl-aluminum, and phosphorous acid4.
This involves removing or destroying the infected parts of the plant or the fruit to prevent further spread of the disease. For example, for apple scab, infected leaves and fruits should be raked up and disposed of in the fall1 2. For black rot, infected branches should be pruned out and burned or buried in the winter3. For Acremonium brown spot, infected fruits and bags should be removed and destroyed after harvest4.
This involves using natural enemies or antagonists to suppress the pathogen or enhance the plant's resistance. For example, for apple scab, some beneficial microorganisms that can inhibit the fungus are Bacillus subtilis , Pseudomonas fluorescens , Streptomyces lydicus , and Trichoderma harzianum 1. These can be applied as biofungicides or biocontrol agents to the plant or the soil. For black rot, some beneficial microorganisms that can compete with or parasitize the fungus are Aureobasidium pullulans , Bacillus subtilis , Cladosporium cladosporioides , and Trichoderma spp.3. These can also be applied as biofungicides or biocontrol agents to the plant or the wound sites. For Acremonium brown spot, no specific biological control is reported, but some general biocontrol agents for water molds are Bacillus subtilis , Pseudomonas fluorescens , Streptomyces spp., and Trichoderma spp.4.
This involves using cultural practices or resistant varieties to reduce the risk or impact of the disease. For example, for apple scab, some cultural practices are planting resistant varieties, pruning to improve air circulation and light penetration, avoiding overhead irrigation or watering early in the day, applying nitrogen fertilizer to fallen leaves to enhance decomposition, and shredding fallen leaves with a mower5 1 2. For black rot, some cultural practices are planting resistant varieties, pruning to avoid wounds or pruning cuts, avoiding overhead irrigation or watering early in the day, applying wound dressing to protect cuts from infection, and removing nearby hosts such as wild brambles or roses3. For Acremonium brown spot, some cultural practices are planting resistant varieties, using clean bags for fruit protection, avoiding contact between bags and soil, and rotating crops with non-host plants4.
["Apple scab: The signs on leaves and fruits are velvety spores that appear on the surface of the spots or lesions. These spores are usually olive-green to black in color and can be seen with a magnifying glass1 2.", "Black rot: The signs on branches are orange droplets that ooze from the cankers. These droplets contain bacterial cells and can be seen with the naked eye. The signs on fruits are small black spots that appear on the rotten areas. These spots are fungal structures called pycnidia that produce spores and can be seen with a magnifying glass.", "Acremonium brown spot: The signs on fruits are white to pink fungal growth that covers the brown spots. This fungal growth produces spores called conidia that can be seen with a microscope6."]

The level of resistance depends on the type of fungus and the fungicide used. It can be measured by different methods, such as spore germination assay, mycelial growth assay, molecular assay, or field assay. For example, for apple scab, the level of resistance to sterol-inhibiting fungicides can be measured by spore germination assay using different concentrations of the fungicide and calculating the effective concentration that inhibits 50% of spore germination (EC50). The level of resistance to strobilurin fungicides can be measured by molecular assay using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence or absence of a point mutation (G143A) in the cytochrome b gene that confers resistance. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease depends on the type of bacteria and its detection method. Some possible methods are: 
Immunological method: This means that the bacteria can be detected by using antibodies that bind specifically to antigens on the bacterial surface. This can be done by using different formats, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM), immunochromatographic strip test (ICT), or lateral flow device (LFD).
