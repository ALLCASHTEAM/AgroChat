Apple is a type of horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruits1. Apple leaflet disease is a type of fungal disease caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis , which also causes apple scab2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by the weather conditions, especially temperature and humidity. The fungus infects the leaves and fruits of the apple tree during wet periods in spring and summer, and overwinters in fallen leaves or infected twigs3. The disease is airborne and can spread rapidly within and between orchards4.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the cultivar, the environmental factors, and the level of infection. Generally, the first symptoms appear on the leaves about two weeks after petal fall, and on the fruits about four weeks after petal fall2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity and moderate temperatures. The optimal temperature range for infection is between 15В°C and 24В°C, and the optimal relative humidity is above 90%2. The disease is less severe in dry or hot climates4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by forming pseudothecia, which are sexual fruiting bodies that contain ascospores, on fallen leaves or infected twigs. These pseudothecia release ascospores in spring when wetted by rain or dew, initiating a new cycle of infection2.
Chemical control involves applying fungicides that are effective against the fungus Venturia inaequalis , such as captan, mancozeb, thiophanate-methyl, or strobilurins1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect can vary depending on the weather conditions, the resistance of the fungus, and the timing of the sprays.
Physical measures include pruning and removing infected leaves and fruits, as well as raking and destroying fallen leaves in autumn to reduce the inoculum source3 4.
Biological control involves using natural enemies or antagonists of the fungus, such as Bacillus subtilis, Aureobasidium pullulans, or Trichoderma harzianum, which can inhibit the growth or germination of the fungus.
Agricultural control involves planting resistant cultivars of apple, such as 'Liberty', 'Enterprise', or 'GoldRush', which have genes that confer immunity or tolerance to the fungus3 4. It also involves avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can increase the susceptibility of the leaves and fruits to infection3.
["This disease are visible effects caused by the plant's reaction to the pathogen.", "They include changes in color, shape, or function of the leaves and fruits.", "On the leaves, the symptoms appear as circular or irregular brown or black spots with a velvety surface3 4.", "The spots may coalesce and cause deformation or curling of the leaves. The infected leaves may also turn yellow and fall prematurely3 4.", "On the fruits, the symptoms appear as brown or black scabs with a corky texture on the skin3 4.", "The scabs may crack open and expose the flesh to secondary infections. The infected fruits may also be deformed or drop early3 4."]
["This disease are physical evidence of the pathogen itself on the plant.", "They include fungal substrates such as conidia or pseudothecia.", "Conidia are asexual spores that are produced by the fungus on the surface of the infected leaves or fruits during wet periods in spring and summer3 4.", "They are microscopic and can only be seen with a magnifying lens or a microscope. They are oval-shaped and have one or two septa (divisions) inside3 4.", "Pseudothecia are sexual fruiting bodies that are formed by the fungus on fallen leaves or infected twigs during winter3 4.", "They are visible to the naked eye as small black dots that resemble pepper grains. They contain ascospores that are released in spring when wetted by rain or dew3 4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is the ability of the fungus to survive or grow in the presence of fungicides that normally inhibit or kill it. The mechanism of resistance is usually based on genetic mutations or gene transfer that alter the target site or metabolic pathway of the fungicide, or increase the efflux or degradation of the fungicide1. The type of resistance agent depends on the mode of action and chemical group of the fungicide. For example, some fungicides that inhibit sterol biosynthesis, such as triazoles or imidazoles, can be resisted by mutations in the CYP51 gene that encodes the target enzyme2. The level of resistance can vary depending on the frequency and intensity of fungicide use, the selection pressure, and the fitness cost of resistance1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is based on molecular techniques that can detect and identify the DNA or RNA of the fungus from infected plant samples. One such method is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can amplify specific regions of the fungal genome and produce visible bands on a gel electrophoresis3. Another method is loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which can amplify DNA under constant temperature and produce fluorescence signals that can be detected by a portable device4. These methods are faster and more sensitive than traditional methods based on culturing or microscopy. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is based on the interaction between the fungus and the plant host at different stages of infection. The fungus produces conidia that land on the plant surface and germinate to form germ tubes and appressoria, which are specialized structures that penetrate the cuticle and cell wall of the plant. The fungus then invades the intercellular spaces of the plant tissue and forms hyphae and haustoria, which are specialized structures that absorb nutrients from the plant cells. The fungus also produces pathogenic effectors, which are molecules that modulate plant defense responses or manipulate plant metabolism to favor fungal growth. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the fungal species and strain, and some examples are proteases, lipases, toxins, or small secreted proteins. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility or incompatibility between the fungus and the plant, which is determined by the presence or absence of specific genes that encode for recognition or resistance factors. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are genes or proteins that are essential for fungal survival, growth, or pathogenicity. One way to identify these targets is by using knockout mutants, which are fungal strains that have a specific gene disrupted or deleted by genetic engineering techniques. By comparing the phenotype and performance of these mutants with wild-type strains, it is possible to determine if a gene is lethal or important for fungal fitness or virulence. Some examples of potential targets are genes involved in cell wall synthesis, ergosterol biosynthesis, signal transduction, oxidative stress response, or effector secretion.
