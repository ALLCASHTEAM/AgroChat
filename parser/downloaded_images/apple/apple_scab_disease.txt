The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop. Horticultural crops are plants that are grown for their edible or ornamental value, such as fruits, vegetables, flowers, and herbs1. The type of disease of this disease is a fungal disease. Fungal diseases are caused by fungi, which are eukaryotic organisms that have cell walls made of chitin and reproduce by spores2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia and ascospores. Conidia are asexual spores that are produced by the fungus on infected leaves and fruits and spread by wind or rain to new hosts3 4. Ascospores are sexual spores that are produced by the fungus in perithecia (fruiting bodies) on fallen leaves and released during wet weather in spring to infect new hosts3 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, moisture, and host susceptibility. The disease cycle begins when ascospores from overwintered leaves infect young leaves and fruits during wet weather in spring. The infection causes olivegreen to black spots on leaves and fruits, which produce conidia that can cause secondary infections throughout the growing season. The disease is more severe in cool and humid regions and can cause premature leaf fall, fruit deformation, and yield loss3 4. The disease is transmitted by wind or rain splash dispersal of spores from infected to healthy tissues3 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually in late spring to early summer, when the primary infection by ascospores occurs. However, the disease can continue to develop throughout the growing season as long as there is sufficient moisture and susceptible host tissue for secondary infection by conidia3 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are moderate to low temperatures (10-25Г‚В°C) and high relative humidity (\&gt;90%) for spore germination and infection3 4. The fungus also requires wetness periods of 9-25 hours for ascospore infection and 6-15 hours for conidial infection depending on the temperature3 4. The fungus prefers acidic soils (pH 4-6) and can survive in a wide range of soil types3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by perithecia on fallen leaves. The fungus forms perithecia on the underside of infected leaves that drop to the ground in autumn. The perithecia contain ascospores that remain dormant until spring, when they are released during wet weather to start a new infection cycle3 4.
Fungicides such as captan, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, myclobutanil, and propiconazole can be used to prevent or reduce apple scab infection1. The type and dose of fungicide depend on the product label and the disease severity. The application period is usually from green tip to midsummer, with intervals of 7 to 14 days depending on weather conditions and disease pressure1. The number of applications may vary from 3 to 10 or more per season1. The control effect of fungicides can range from 50 to 90% or more, depending on the fungicide efficacy, timing, coverage, and resistance2.
Pruning and removing infected leaves and fruits can help reduce the inoculum source and improve air circulation and spray penetration3. Sanitation practices such as raking and destroying fallen leaves can also help reduce overwintering spores3.
There are no commercially available biological control agents for apple scab, but some studies have reported the potential of using antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Trichoderma harzianum to inhibit the growth or germination of the apple scab fungus4.
Planting resistant or tolerant varieties of apple or crabapple is the most effective way to prevent apple scab5. Some examples of resistant varieties are 'Enterprise', 'Freedom', 'GoldRush', 'Liberty', 'Prima', and 'Redfree'5. Other cultural practices such as proper irrigation, fertilization, and weed management can also help enhance plant health and resistance3.
["Olive-green to brown spots with fringed margins, up to 0.5 inch in diameter, often along leaf veins or near leaf margins. Spots may coalesce and form large necrotic areas. Infected leaves may curl, twist, yellow, and drop prematurely.", "Olive-green to black spots with corky or cracked surfaces, up to 0.5 inch in diameter, often near fruit calyx or stem end. Spots may coalesce and deform fruits. Infected fruits may crack, shrivel, or drop prematurely."]
["Velvety black masses of asexual spores (conidia) on the lower surface of leaf spots in late spring to early summer.", "Velvety black masses of conidia on fruit spots in late spring to early summer.", "Small black dots of sexual spores (ascospores) embedded in leaf tissues in late fall to early spring."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of apple scab disease, Venturia inaequalis, is a major problem for apple growers, as the fungus can develop resistance to various fungicides, such as dodine, benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, strobilurins, and anilinopyrimidines1. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the target site, overexpression of efflux pumps, or alteration of metabolic pathways1 2. The type of resistance agent may depend on the fungicide mode of action, such as inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis, respiration, or DNA synthesis1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide dose, frequency, and mixture, as well as the fungal population structure and fitness1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of apple scab disease is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which can detect the fungal DNA in infected plant tissues within an hour3. This method is simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of apple scab disease is not fully understood, but it may involve the penetration of the fungal spores (conidia or ascospores) through natural openings or wounds on the plant surface, followed by the colonization of the intercellular spaces and the formation of infection structures called haustoria that absorb nutrients from the host cells4. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but some candidates have been identified by transcriptome analysis4. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host susceptibility, environmental factors, and fungal genetic diversity5. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of apple scab disease are not clear, as there is no evidence that bacteria are involved in this disease. However, some studies have suggested that endophytic bacteria may have a beneficial role in enhancing plant resistance to fungal pathogens. Some examples of endophytic bacteria that can colonize apple tissues are Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Streptomyces.
