Apple is a type of horticultural crop, it is grown for its edible fruits and ornamental value1. Cedar apple rust is a type of fungal disease, caused by the fungus <em>Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae</em>2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of cedar apple rust is sexual and asexual, involving five different types of spores3. The fungus produces aeciospores on apples and other rosaceous hosts, which infect junipers and other cupressaceous hosts. On junipers, the fungus forms galls that produce teliospores, which germinate to form basidiospores. The basidiospores infect apples and other rosaceous hosts, where the fungus produces <em>pycnia</em> that produce spermatia and receptive hyphae. The spermatia and receptive hyphae fuse to form aecia, which produce aeciospores3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of cedar apple rust is seasonal and airborne4. The disease cycle depends on the availability of both rosaceous and cupressaceous hosts, and the environmental conditions that favor spore production and dispersal. The fungus spreads by wind-blown spores that can travel long distances5.
The period of disease onset for cedar apple rust is spring to early summer6. This is when the teliospores on junipers germinate and release basidiospores that infect rosaceous hosts. The symptoms on rosaceous hosts appear as yellow to orange spots on leaves and fruits, which later produce aeciospores that infect cupressaceous hosts6. The environmental conditions required for cedar apple rust are warm and moist. The fungus needs high humidity and rainfall for spore production and germination. The optimal temperature range for infection is 50 to 75Г‚В°F.
The overwintering method of cedar apple rust is dormant galls on junipers. The fungus survives in the galls that form on juniper branches after infection by aeciospores. The galls swell and produce teliospores in response to spring rains.
fungicides such as triadimefon, myclobutanil, propiconazole, or mancozeb can be applied to protect the apple foliage and fruit from infection1 2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect of fungicides can vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the fungus3.
Pruning and removing infected juniper branches or galls can reduce the inoculum sources and prevent the further spread of the disease1 2 3. Pruning cuts should be disinfected with alcohol or bleach between cuts3.
there are no commercially available biological agents for controlling apple cedar apple rust. However, some studies have reported that antagonistic fungi such as <em>Trichoderma</em> spp. and <em>Cladosporium</em> spp. can inhibit the growth of the fungus <em>in vitro</em> or <em>in vivo</em> . More research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of these agents in field conditions.
planting resistant or tolerant cultivars, avoiding planting junipers near apples, maintaining good air circulation and sunlight penetration, and practicing proper sanitation and irrigation can help reduce the susceptibility and incidence of apple cedar apple rust1 2 3.
["small yellow spots appear on the upper surface of the leaves in late spring, which enlarge and turn orange-red with black dots in the center. The spots may coalesce and cause leaf distortion, chlorosis, and premature defoliation1 2 4.", "similar spots on leaves appear on the fruit surface, which may crack and deform the fruit. The infected fruits may drop prematurely or remain on the tree with reduced quality1 2 4."]
["brown to reddish-brown galls appear on the branches or twigs of infected junipers. The galls are round to kidney-shaped and vary in size from 0.5 to 5 cm in diameter. The galls produce orange gelatinous horns or tendrils during wet weather in spring, which releases spores of the fungus1 2 4 5.", "Black dots (<em>pycnia</em>) appear in the center of the spots on leaves or fruits, which produce pycniospores (asexual spores) of the fungus. Later, cup-shaped structures (aecia) develop under the spots on leaves or fruits, which produce aeciospores (sexual spores) of the fungus1 2 4 5."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of cedar apple rust, <em>Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae</em>, is not well studied, but some reports suggest that it may have reduced sensitivity to some fungicides, such as mancozeb and myclobutanil1. The mechanism of resistance is not clear, but it may involve changes in the fungal metabolism or detoxification2. The type of resistance agent is not known, but it may be related to the fungal genotype or phenotype2. The level of resistance may depend on the fungicide dose and the fungal isolate1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of cedar apple rust is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, which can detect the fungal DNA in infected plant tissues within a few hours3. This method is accurate, reliable, and specific3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of cedar apple rust is not fully understood, but it may involve the production of toxins and enzymes that degrade plant cell walls and membranes4. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but some candidates have been identified by transcriptome analysis4. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host susceptibility, environmental factors, and fungal genetic diversity5. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of cedar apple rust are not clear, as there is no evidence that bacteria are involved in this disease. However, some studies have suggested that endophytic bacteria may have a beneficial role in enhancing plant resistance to fungal pathogens. Some examples of endophytic bacteria that can colonize apple tissues are <em>Bacillus, Pseudomonas</em>, and <em>Streptomyces</em>.
