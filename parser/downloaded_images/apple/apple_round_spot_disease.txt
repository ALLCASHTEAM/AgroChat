Apple is a type of horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruit1. Apple round spot disease is a type of fungal disease that is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis2 3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing airborne spores that infect the leaves and fruits of apple trees during wet spring weather2 3 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by rain and humidity levels, which favor the dispersal and germination of the fungal spores5 3 4. The disease can also be transmitted by insects, such as aphids, that feed on infected plant tissues2.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually in the spring, when the new leaves and buds emerge and are susceptible to infection2 3 4. The symptoms can persist throughout the growing season until harvest time2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool and moist climates, with temperatures ranging from 50 to 75В°F and relative humidity above 60%2 4. The disease is more severe in areas with frequent rainfall or irrigation2 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in the fallen leaves that remain on the ground or in the tree canopy2 3 4. The fungus produces spores in these leaves that can infect the new growth in the next spring2 3 4.
Fungicides containing active ingredients such as myclobutanil, thiophanate methyl, captan, or mancozeb can be applied at regular intervals from just before bud break until petal fall to prevent infection1 2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the weather conditions1 2 3. The control effect can vary depending on the resistance level of the fungus and the timing of the sprays1 2 3.
Pruning out dead or diseased branches and removing infected plant material from the area can reduce sources of spores for future infections4 2. Shredding fallen leaves in the fall with a mower or applying nitrogen to enhance leaf decomposition can also help reduce inoculum5 1.
There are no effective biological control agents for this disease available commercially1.
Planting scab-resistant cultivars of apples is the best way to manage scab6 3. Some examples of resistant cultivars are 'Liberty', 'Empire', 'Freedom', 'GoldRush', and 'Enterprise'1. Pruning apple trees to open up branching and allow more air circulation can also help reduce humidity and disease severity5 1. Avoiding overhead irrigation or watering early in the day can also minimize leaf wetness duration1.
["On leaves: dull, olive-green to brown spots that may grow into large circles with a velvety surface; leaves may become dwarfed, twisted, yellow, or fall off prematurely1 6 2.", "On fruits: olive-green to black spots that may develop into lesions with a rough, wart-like, or corky surface; fruits may crack open, drop early, or become deformed and unfit for eating1 6 2."]
["On leaves: fungal spores can be seen under a microscope on the surface of the spots; they are dark brown, oval-shaped, and have a single germ pore1.", "On fruits: fungal spores can be seen under a microscope on the surface of the lesions; they are similar to those on leaves but smaller and more numerous1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is mainly based on the Vf gene, which confers resistance to most strains of the fungus Venturia inaequalis1 2. However, some scab strains have evolved to overcome this gene and can infect resistant varieties1 2. The mechanism of resistance is related to the recognition of fungal effectors by plant receptors and the activation of defense responses2. Other sources of scab resistance such as Vr, VM and VA genes are present in some varieties such as 'Liberty' and provide additional resistance1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is by using a microscope to observe the spores on the surface of the infected leaves or fruits3 4. The spores are dark brown, oval-shaped, and have a single germ pore3 4. They can be distinguished from other fungal spores by their size, shape, and color3 4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is by producing airborne spores that infect the leaves and fruits of apple trees during wet spring weather3 4 5. The fungus penetrates the plant cuticle and grows into the epidermis and mesophyll cells, causing necrotic spots3 4. The fungus produces various pathogenic effectors that modulate plant immunity and metabolism, such as proteases, lipases, polygalacturonases, and toxins2 . The fungus can infect different plants within the genus Malus, but not other genera such as Sorbus or Pyrus, due to host-specific strains and resistance genes3 . 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are not well known, but some studies have identified some genes that are involved in plant defense or susceptibility to scab infection, such as MLO, RIN4, NPR1, and WRKY transcription factors2 . Knockout or overexpression of these genes can affect the resistance or susceptibility of apple plants to scab infection2 .
