Apple is a type of horticultural crop1 that is grown for its fruits and ornamental value. Apple Nitrogen Deficiency is a type of physiological disease2 that is caused by insufficient supply of nitrogen to the plant, rather than by a pathogen.
Since Apple Nitrogen Deficiency is not caused by a pathogen, there is no mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease. Since Apple Nitrogen Deficiency is not caused by a pathogen, there is no epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease. However, some factors that may influence the occurrence and severity of this disease are soil type, soil pH, soil organic matter, soil moisture, fertilizer application, rootstock, cultivar, crop load, pruning, and environmental conditions3.
The period of disease onset for Apple Nitrogen Deficiency is usually in the late summer or early fall1, when the demand for nitrogen is high due to fruit development and storage. The symptoms may become more evident as the leaves age and senesce. The environmental conditions required for Apple Nitrogen Deficiency are those that limit the availability or uptake of nitrogen by the plant. Some examples are low soil nitrogen levels, high soil pH, low soil organic matter, low soil moisture, cold soil temperatures, root damage or disease, excessive or imbalanced fertilization, and competition from weeds1 2.
Since Apple Nitrogen Deficiency is not caused by a pathogen, there is no overwintering method of this disease. However, the nitrogen status of the plant may affect its winter hardiness and susceptibility to frost damage1.
Chemical control is not applicable for this disease, since it is not caused by a pathogen.
Physical measures such as cutting off the infected parts are not effective, since the symptoms are widespread and uniform on the leaves.
Biological control is not relevant for this disease, since there is no biological agent involved.

["Apple Nitrogen Deficiency are pale green to yellow leaves that develop uniformly on the leaf with no patterning or mottling, and small leaf size1.", "The symptoms first appear on older leaves, since nitrogen is mobile in trees and moves to younger leaves.", "The leaves may drop early in the fall. The shoot growth is reduced, and the twigs are thin. The fruit set may be light with considerable June drop. The fruits are smaller and often color and mature early1."]
["Apple Nitrogen Deficiency, since there is no physical evidence of the pathogen itself on the plant.", "The diagnosis of this disease is based on visual assessment of the symptoms, soil testing, and leaf analysis1."]
some general information about the resistance of some phytopathogenic fungi to plant glucosinolate hydrolysis products, which are toxic compounds produced by plants under nitrogen deficiency stress1. According to this source, some fungi can detoxify these compounds by conjugation to glutathione or hydrolysis to amines1. One example is the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which can infect many glucosinolate-producing plants and has an isothiocyanate hydrolase enzyme that converts isothiocyanates into non-toxic products1. This enzyme also contributes to the virulence of the fungus on these plants1. 
some general information about some methods for detecting phytopathogenic bacteria in plants, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescence microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and biosensors2. These methods vary in their sensitivity, specificity, speed, cost, and applicability2. You may need to consult an expert or a laboratory for more details on these methods and their suitability for your purpose. 
some general information about the mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of plants by some fungi and bacteria, such as Verticillium dahliae and Pseudomonas syringae. According to these sources, these pathogens can infect plants by producing various effectors that modulate plant immunity and physiology. These effectors can be secreted proteins or small molecules that target different plant components, such as receptors, signaling pathways, transcription factors, hormones, or metabolites. The type and number of effectors may vary depending on the pathogen species, strain, host plant, and environmental conditions. 
some general information about some potential targets of phytopathogenic bacteria in plants, such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), and nitric oxide (NO). These are plant hormones or signaling molecules that are involved in plant defense responses against pathogens. Some phytopathogenic bacteria can manipulate these molecules by producing effectors that either mimic, degrade, or inhibit them. For example, some strains of Pseudomonas syringae produce a phytotoxin called coronatine, which mimics JA and suppresses SA-mediated resistance in plants.
