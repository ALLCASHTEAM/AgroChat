Apple is a type of horticultural crop1, which means it is grown for its fruits and not for its seeds or fibers. Black rot is a disease of apples that infects fruit, leaves, and bark caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa2.


Black rot overwinters in cankers on limbs, branches, trunks and mummified fruit left behind after thinning applications. The spores (conidia and ascospores) are released early in the season (bud swell) and continue to be released throughout the season4.
fungicides such as captan, mancozeb, thiophanate-methyl, or myclobutanil can be applied during the growing season to protect the foliage and fruit from infection1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect of fungicides can vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the fungus2.
pruning and removing infected branches, twigs, cankers, and mummified fruits can reduce the inoculum sources and prevent further spread of the disease1 2 3. Pruning cuts should be made at least 15 cm below the visible canker margin and disinfected with alcohol or bleach between cuts2.
there are no commercially available biological agents for controlling apple black rot. However, some studies have reported that antagonistic bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis or Pseudomonas fluorescens can inhibit the growth of the fungus in vitro or in vivo. More research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of these agents in field conditions.
planting resistant or tolerant cultivars, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, maintaining good air circulation and sunlight penetration, and practicing proper sanitation and irrigation can help reduce the susceptibility and incidence of apple black rot1 2 3.
["small purple spots appear on the upper surface of the leaves in early spring, which enlarge to form circular lesions with purple margins and brown centers. The lesions may coalesce and cause leaf distortion, chlorosis, and premature defoliation1 3. This phase of the disease is also known as frogeye leaf spot.", "dark brown to black lesions appear on the fruit surface, usually near the calyx end. The lesions expand and cover most of the fruit, causing it to shrivel and mummify. The infected fruits may remain attached to the tree or drop prematurely1 3. The fungus may produce black pycnidia (spore-bearing structures) on the surface of the lesions.", "reddish-brown to black cankers develop on the bark of infected branches or twigs. The cankers are slightly sunken and may girdle and kill the affected limbs. The fungus may also produce black pycnidia on the surface of the cankers1 3."]
["The presence of black pycnidia on the surface of infected leaves, fruits, or branches. The pycnidia are small (0.2-0.5 mm in diameter), spherical to flask-shaped structures that contain conidia (asexual spores) of the fungus1 3. The conidia are hyaline, unicellular, oval to ellipsoid, and measure 5-8 x 2-3 Г‚Вµm3.", "The presence of perithecia (sexual spore-bearing structures) on infected plant tissues. The perithecia are black, spherical to ovoid structures that contain ascospores (sexual spores) of the fungus1 3. The ascospores are hyaline, unicellular, fusiform to sickle-shaped, and measure 12-18 x 2-3 Г‚Вµm3."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of apple black rot, Botryosphaeria obtusa, has some mechanisms of resistance to fungicides, such as reduced sensitivity to benzimidazoles and strobilurins1. The type of resistance agent is not clear, but it may involve mutations in the target site or efflux pumps2. The level of resistance varies depending on the fungicide and the fungal isolate1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of apple black rot is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which can detect the fungal DNA in infected plant tissues within an hour3. This method is simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of apple black rot is not well understood, but it may involve the production of toxins and enzymes that degrade plant cell walls and membranes4. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but some candidates have been identified by transcriptome analysis4. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host susceptibility, environmental factors, and fungal genetic diversity5. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of apple black rot are not clear, as there is no evidence that bacteria are involved in this disease. However, some studies have suggested that endophytic bacteria may have a beneficial role in enhancing plant resistance to fungal pathogens. Some examples of endophytic bacteria that can colonize apple tissues are Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Streptomyces.
