Apple is a type of horticultural crop1, which means it is grown for its fruits and not for its seeds or fibers. Phosphorus deficiency in apples is not a type of disease, but a physiological disorder2 that affects the growth and quality of the apple fruits and trees. It is caused by low levels of phosphorus in the soil or poor uptake by the roots3.
Since phosphorus deficiency is not a disease, it does not have a pathogenic fungus or a mode of reproduction. Since phosphorus deficiency is not a disease, it does not have an epidemiological pattern or a mode of transmission. It can affect any apple tree that grows in soils with low phosphorus availability or has a poorly developed root system4.
The period of disease onset for phosphorus deficiency in apples depends on the severity of the condition and the stage of growth of the tree. It can start as early as bud burst or as late as fruit development1. The symptoms include reduced shoot growth, dark-red branches and leaves, small and poorly colored fruits, and low temperature breakdown in storage3 1 2. The environmental conditions required for phosphorus deficiency in apples are soils with low phosphorus content or high phosphate capacity, acidic or very alkaline (calcareaus) soils, low organic matter, cold or wet conditions, and iron rich soils2.
Since phosphorus deficiency is not a disease, it does not have an overwintering method. However, it can persist from one season to another if the soil conditions are not improved or the root system is not enhanced2.
