Apple is a horticultural crop that is grown for its fruits1. Herbicide damage is not a disease, but a type of physiological disorder caused by exposure to chemicals that interfere with plant growth and development1 2.
Not applicable, since herbicide damage is not caused by a pathogenic fungus. Herbicide damage can occur through drift, volatilization, or root uptake of herbicides that are sprayed on nearby lawns or crop fields to kill weeds1. Drift happens when herbicides move through the air in droplets or vapor during an application, causing injury to nearby sensitive plants that they land on1. Volatilization happens when herbicides evaporate in the hours or days after application, and move through the air1. Root uptake happens when herbicides applied as dry formulations to soils are watered in, and can be taken up by roots of nontarget plants3.
Herbicide damage can occur at any time during the growing season, depending on when the herbicide application occurs and when the plants are exposed to it1. However, some symptoms may not appear until later in the season or even the following year4. Herbicide damage can occur under various environmental conditions, but some factors that increase the risk of drift or volatilization are hot, dry, windy, or completely still conditions1. Some factors that increase the risk of root uptake are high soil moisture, low organic matter, and low soil pH3.

There is no specific chemical treatment for herbicide damage, but some products may help reduce the stress on the affected trees and promote recovery. For example, some studies have suggested that applying prohexadione-calcium (Apogee) or hydrogen cyanamide (Dormex) after herbicide exposure may reduce the severity of symptoms and improve tree growth1 2. However, these products have their own risks and limitations, and should be used with caution and according to the label instructions.
Pruning off the damaged branches or suckers may help prevent further spread of the injury and improve the appearance of the trees3. However, pruning should be done carefully to avoid creating large wounds that may invite pathogens or pests. Pruning should also be avoided during periods of high disease pressure or extreme weather conditions.
There is no known biological agent that can counteract herbicide damage on apple trees.
The best way to prevent herbicide damage is to avoid spraying herbicides near apple trees or when conditions favor drift or volatilization3. Some practices that can help reduce the risk of herbicide exposure are: Use a shielded boom or a hooded sprayer to direct the spray away from the tree trunks and foliage4 5. Use low spray pressure and large droplet size to minimize drift potential3.
