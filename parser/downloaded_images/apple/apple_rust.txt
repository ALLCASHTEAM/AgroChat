Apple Rust affects apple and crabapple trees, which are horticultural crops1 2. Horticultural crops are plants that are grown for their edible or ornamental value1. Apple Rust is a fungal disease caused by different species of the fungus Gymnosporangium1 2 3 4. Fungal diseases are infections caused by microscopic organisms that feed on organic matter3.
The pathogenic fungus of Apple Rust reproduces by producing different types of spores, depending on the host plant. On junipers and red cedars, it produces aeciospores and teliospores, which form galls and horns on the branches1 2 4. On apples and crabapples, it produces basidiospores and pycniospores, which cause leaf spots and fruit lesions1 2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of Apple Rust is airborne5 2 4. The spores are carried by the wind from one host plant to another, completing a two-year life cycle1 2 4. The disease is more prevalent in wet years, when the spores are released more easily1 4.
The period of disease onset for Apple Rust varies depending on the host plant and the environmental conditions. On junipers and red cedars, the galls form in late fall and swell in spring, releasing spores during rainy periods from April to June1 2 4. On apples and crabapples, the leaf spots appear in late spring or early summer, and the fruit lesions develop later in the season1 2 4. The environmental conditions required for Apple Rust are moisture and warmth1 2 4. The fungus needs wet weather to germinate and infect the host plants, and temperatures between 46В°F and 75В°F to grow and develop1 4. The disease is less severe in dry or cold climates1.
The overwintering method of Apple Rust is dormancy124. The fungus survives the winter as spores or galls on the host plants, waiting for favorable conditions to resume its life cycle124.
Fungicides can be applied to protect the apple and crabapple trees from infection by the spores. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect depend on the product label and the local conditions1 2 3. Some examples of fungicides that can be used are myclobutanil, propiconazole, sulfur, and copper1 2 3.
Infected branches and galls can be pruned and removed from the junipers and red cedars to reduce the source of inoculum1 2. Infected leaves and fruits can be raked and disposed of from the apple and crabapple trees to prevent further spread1 2.
There are no known biological agents that can effectively control this disease1.
The most effective way to prevent this disease is to interrupt the disease cycle by avoiding planting junipers and red cedars near apple and crabapple trees, or vice versa4 1 2. A distance of at least a few hundred yards is recommended1. Alternatively, disease resistant varieties of both hosts can be planted to reduce the susceptibility1 2.
["On apple and crabapple trees: Bright orange to red leaf spots that may coalesce and cause premature leaf drop; yellow or orange spots or bands on the fruits that may crack or deform; reduced fruit quality and yield123.", "On junipers and red cedars: Woody galls on the branches that may cause witches' brooms or swollen stems; orange gelatinous horns that emerge from the galls during wet weather and release spores; branch dieback or reduced vigor123."]
["On apple and crabapple trees: Tiny black dots (pycnia) on the upper surface of the leaf spots; hair-like structures (aecia) on the lower surface of the leaf spots or on the fruit lesions13.", "On junipers and red cedars: Brown to black galls with dimples or depressions on the branches; orange gelatinous horns that protrude from the galls during wet weather13."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus may have genetic or biochemical mechanisms that allow it to overcome the host defense responses, such as detoxifying enzymes, effector proteins, or mutations . Type of resistance agent: The fungus may be resistant to some fungicides that are used to control it, such as triazoles, strobilurins, or benzimidazoles . Level of resistance: The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal strain, the host plant, the environmental conditions, and the fungicide dose and frequency . 
Morphological identification: The fungus can be identified by its characteristic galls and horns on junipers and red cedars, and its leaf spots and fruit lesions on apples and crabapples1 2 3. However, this method may not be accurate or reliable, as there are other rust fungi that cause similar symptoms1. Molecular identification: The fungus can be identified by its DNA or RNA sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other molecular techniques. However, this method may require specialized equipment and expertise, and may not be feasible for rapid diagnosis. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus produces different types of spores that infect different host plants. On junipers and red cedars, it produces aeciospores and teliospores that form galls and horns on the branches. On apples and crabapples, it produces basidiospores and pycniospores that cause leaf spots and fruit lesions123. The fungus also secretes various effector proteins that modulate the host defense responses and facilitate infection. Some examples of effectors are GjSTE1, GjCFEM1, GjCHI1, GjNLP1, GjNEP1, GjPG1, GjXEG1, GjXTH1, GjGH28-1, GjGH28-2, GjGH28-3. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus has a heteroecious life cycle that requires two different host plants to complete its development. The fungus infects junipers and red cedars through wounds or natural openings on the branches, forming galls that overwinter and produce horns that release spores in spring. The fungus infects apples and crabapples through stomata or cuticles on the leaves or fruits, forming leaf spots that produce pycnia that attract insects that transfer spores to other plants. The fungus also forms aecia on the lower surface of the leaf spots or on the fruit lesions that release spores that infect junipers and red cedars123. Environmental conditions: The fungus needs moisture and warmth to germinate and infect the host plants. The optimal temperature range for infection is between 46В°F and 75В°F. The optimal wetness duration for infection is between 6 and 9 hours. The disease is more severe in wet years than in dry years13. 
Knockout lethal genes: These are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of the fungus. If these genes are disrupted or deleted, the fungus may lose its pathogenicity or viability. Some examples of knockout lethal genes are GjSTE1 (a transcription factor), GjCFEM1 (a cell wall protein), GjCHI1 (a chitinase), GjNLP1 (a necrosis-inducing protein), GjNEP1 (a necrosis-enhancing protein)
