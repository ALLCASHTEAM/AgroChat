The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop1, as it is grown for its fruits and ornamental value. The type of disease of this disease is a fungal disease2 3, caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis, also known as apple scab.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is a conidium4, which is a type of asexual spore that is produced in chains on specialized structures called conidiophores. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are airborne5 3, as the spores are released from infected leaves and carried by wind, rain, or irrigation to new hosts.
The period of disease onset for this disease is spring2 3, when the spores germinate on wet surfaces and infect the young leaves, flowers, and fruits. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid2 3, as the spores need several hours of moisture and a temperature around 70 degrees Fahrenheit to germinate and infect.
The overwintering method of this disease is in diseased leaves on the ground2 3, where the fungus survives until the next spring and produces new spores.
Fungicides containing active ingredients such as pyraclostrobin + boscalid, captan, mancozeb, fludioxonil and fluopyram + febuconazole can be effective against apple scab1. They should be applied at regular intervals from just before bud break until petal fall, following the label instructions for dose, frequency, and safety precautions2 3.
Pruning infected branches and removing fallen leaves and fruits can help reduce the sources of inoculum and improve air circulation in the canopy2 3 4 5. Infected plant material should be disposed of in the garbage and not composted3 4.
There are no commercially available biological agents for apple scab control, but some studies have suggested that certain strains of bacteria or fungi may have antagonistic effects against the pathogen.
Planting resistant cultivars of apples is the best way to prevent apple scab infection2 3. Some examples of resistant varieties are 'Liberty', 'Empire', 'Enterprise', 'Goldrush', and 'Redfree'2. Avoiding overhead irrigation and maintaining optimal soil fertility and pH can also help reduce disease severity2 3.
["On leaves: dull, olive-green round spots that gradually grow into brown or black large circles with a velvet-like surface up to half an inch across; dwarfed or twisted leaves that turn yellow and drop prematurely2 3 4.", "On fruits: slightly raised, black spots with a rough, wart-like or corky surface, and cracks in the fruit; deformed and unappealing fruits that may drop before harvest or show symptoms during storage2 3 4."]
["On leaves: the presence of conidiophores (specialized fungal structures that produce spores) on the surface of the spots; these can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope.", "On fruits: the presence of pseudothecia (small black dots that contain sexual spores) on the surface of the spots; these can also be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope."]
The mechanism of resistance: The fungus can develop resistance to certain fungicides by mutating its genes that encode the target enzymes or transporters of the fungicides . The type of resistance agent: The fungicides that the fungus can become resistant to include strobilurins (QoI), demethylation inhibitors (DMI), and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHI) . The level of resistance: The level of resistance varies depending on the fungicide group, the fungal strain, and the environmental conditions. Some studies have reported high levels of resistance to QoI and DMI fungicides in some regions, while others have found low to moderate levels of resistance to SDHI fungicides . 
I do not have this information. Apple scab is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium. There is no phytopathogenic bacterium associated with this disease. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus produces several types of effectors that can manipulate the host plant's defense responses, such as secreted proteins, secondary metabolites, and small RNAs. The exact number and function of these effectors are not fully understood, but some studies have identified more than 100 candidate effectors in the fungal genome. 
The fungus can infect different species and cultivars of apples and crabapples, but some are more resistant than others1 2. The resistance may depend on the presence or absence of certain genes or alleles in the plant that can recognize or respond to the fungal effectors. The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are:
