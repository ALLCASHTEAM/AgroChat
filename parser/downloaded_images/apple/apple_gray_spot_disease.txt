Apple is a type of horticultural crop, which is a crop that is grown for its fruits, flowers, or ornamental value1. Apple gray spot disease is a type of fungal disease, caused by multiple types of fungi working together1 2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungi of this disease is conidium, which is a type of asexual spore that is produced by some fungi3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are airborne and rainsplash. The fungal spores can be carried by wind or rain to infect new apple trees1 2.
The period of disease onset for this disease is late summer and early autumn, when the weather is humid and warm1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, warm temperature, and poor air circulation. These factors favor the growth and spread of the fungi1 2.
The overwintering method of this disease is dormant spores on the surface of infected fruits or leaves. These spores can survive the winter and germinate in the spring when conditions are favorable1 2.
Applying a commercial fungicide to the apple tree every two weeks as soon as new shoots appear in spring1 2. Some examples of fungicides that can be used are myclobutanil, fenbuconazole, and potassium bicarbonate3 4. The application dose, period, and number of applications may vary depending on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect of fungicides is usually high if applied correctly and timely.
Pruning and removing the infected fruits and leaves from the tree and the ground1 2. This reduces the source of fungal spores and improves air circulation in the canopy. Pruning shears should be sterilized between cuts to prevent spreading the infection2.
There is no effective biological control agent for this disease available commercially. However, some natural enemies of the fungi, such as predatory mites and parasitic wasps, may help reduce the population of fungal spores5.
Planting resistant or tolerant apple varieties, such as Enterprise, Freedom, and Liberty2. Avoiding overhead irrigation and excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can create favorable conditions for fungal growth2 6.
["Black or gray blotches or speckles on the fruit surface, which may make the fruit look unappealing and reduce its shelf life1 2.", "No symptoms on the leaves or shoots, unlike other fungal diseases such as apple scab or powdery mildew2."]
["Fungal spores on the surface of infected fruits or leaves, which can be seen under a microscope or with a magnifying glass2 6.", "Fungal substrates, such as conidia or hyphae, which are structures that produce or carry spores4 6."]
The genetic diversity of the fungal population, which may allow some strains to adapt to different environmental conditions or host resistance1. The presence of multiple fungal species that cause the disease, which may increase the complexity and variability of the infection2 3. The ability to produce dormant spores that can survive unfavorable conditions and germinate when conditions are favorable2 3. 
Microscopic examination of the fungal spores or substrates on the surface of infected fruits or leaves, using a microscope or a magnifying glass2 . Molecular detection of the fungal DNA or RNA using techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) . Cultural isolation of the fungi from infected fruits or leaves using selective media and incubation conditions. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors, which are molecules that the fungi secrete to manipulate the host plant's defense or metabolism. Some examples of effectors that have been identified in some fungi that cause apple gray spot disease are necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins (NEP1-like proteins), cerato-platanin proteins, and small cysteine-rich proteins . The differences in infestation of different plants, which may depend on the host plant's susceptibility or resistance, as well as the fungal strain's virulence or aggressiveness. Some apple varieties that are resistant or tolerant to apple gray spot disease are Enterprise, Freedom, and Liberty2. 
Knockout lethal genes, which are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of the fungi, and whose disruption or deletion would result in fungal death or reduced fitness. Some examples of knockout lethal genes that have been identified in some fungi that cause apple gray spot disease are genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, such as chitin synthase and glucan synthase genes.
