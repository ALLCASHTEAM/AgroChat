Ziziphus jujuba is a horticultural crop that produces edible fruits1 2. The rust disease of Ziziphus jujuba is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Phakopsora zizyphi-vulgaris1 3.
The pathogenic fungus of this disease reproduces by producing urediniospores and teliospores that are dispersed by wind3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are airborne, as the spores of the fungus can infect new hosts by landing on their leaves4.
The period of disease onset for this disease is late summer to early autumn, when the temperature and humidity are favorable for spore germination and infection3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30Г‚В°C) and high humidity (80-90%)3.
The overwintering method of this disease is teliospores that can survive on fallen leaves or twigs until the next spring3.
spraying fungicides such as mancozeb, zineb or wettable sulphur1 2.
removing and burning the infected leaves or fruits to reduce the inoculum2.
applying the protein HarpinXoo that can induce systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in the plants and reduce the disease incidence by up to 87.1%1.

["small irregular reddish brown pustules on the upper surface of the leaves, which later coalesce and cover the entire leaf surface. The infected leaves become dry and fall off prematurely. The fruits may also develop pustules and become deformed or cracked2 3."]
["urediniospores and teliospores of the fungus that can be observed on the lower surface of the leaves or on the fruits. The urediniospores are yellowish brown and oval, while the teliospores are dark brown and two-celled2 3."]
he resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some possible mechanisms are mutation, efflux pumps, and degradation enzymes that can reduce the sensitivity or efficacy of fungicides1 2. The type of resistance agent may vary depending on the fungicide used, such as benzimidazoles, triazoles, or strobilurins1 2. The level of resistance may depend on the frequency and dose of fungicide application, as well as the genetic diversity and fitness of the fungus1 2. 
I do not have a quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease, because this disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium. The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not well understood, but some possible factors are spore germination, appressorium formation, penetration, and colonization of the host tissue by the fungus3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but they may be involved in suppressing or evading the host defence response3. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host susceptibility, resistance, or tolerance to the fungus3. 
I do not have the potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease, because this disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium.
