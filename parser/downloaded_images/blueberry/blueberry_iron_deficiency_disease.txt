Blueberries are a horticultural crop that are grown for their edible fruits1. Iron deficiency in blueberries is a physiological disease that occurs when a lack of iron prevents the leaves from producing chlorophyll2 3. It is not caused by a pathogen, but by high soil pH or other factors that affect iron availability1 4.
Since iron deficiency is not caused by a pathogen, there is no mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus for this disease. I do not have this information. Since iron deficiency is not caused by a pathogen, there is no epidemiological pattern or mode of transmission for this disease. I do not have this information.
The period of disease onset for iron deficiency in blueberries is usually in the spring, when new growth emerges2. The environmental conditions required for iron deficiency in blueberries are high soil pH (&gt;5.2), high calcium or phosphorus levels, excessive irrigation, poor drainage, or root damage1 4 3.
Since iron deficiency is not caused by a pathogen, there is no overwintering method for this disease. I do not have this information.
Iron deficiency in blueberries is often caused by high soil pH (&gt;5.2), which reduces the availability of iron for the plants1 2. Therefore, one of the main control strategies is to lower the soil pH with sulfur1 3. This may take several months to have an effect, so a temporary solution is to apply iron chelates or foliar sprays of iron sulfate4. However, these are not long-term solutions and may cause toxicity if overused4. Other control strategies include avoiding excessive irrigation, fertilization, or liming, which can increase soil pH or interfere with iron uptake4 2.

["Iron deficiency causes chlorosis, or yellowing, of the leaves, especially the young leaves4 1 2. The yellowing is interveinal, meaning that the veins remain green while the rest of the leaf turns yellow1 2. This is because iron is involved in chlorophyll production, which gives the leaves their green color4. Iron deficiency can also cause stunted growth, reduced yield, and in some cases, death of the plant4."]
["Iron deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogen, but a nutritional disorder caused by environmental factors4. Therefore, there are no disease signs such as fungal substrates or bacterial secretions. The only way to confirm iron deficiency is by testing the soil pH and/or the plant tissue for iron content4 3."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of iron deficiency in blueberries is Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi, which causes mummy berry disease1. This fungus has two stages of infection: a primary stage that affects the young shoots and leaves, and a secondary stage that affects the flowers and fruits1. The fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as benzimidazoles and dicarboximides. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the genes that encode for the target proteins of the fungicides. The level of resistance varies depending on the fungal strain and the fungicide used. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of iron deficiency in blueberries is molecular detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). These methods can identify the fungus from infected plant tissues or soil samples within a few hours. They are more sensitive and specific than conventional methods such as culturing or microscopy. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of iron deficiency in blueberries is ascospore infection followed by conidial infection1. Ascospores are produced by cup-shaped structures called apothecia that emerge from overwintering mummies on the ground1. Ascospores are dispersed by wind or rain and infect the young shoots and leaves, causing blight and necrosis1. Conidia are produced by the blighted tissues and are carried by wind or insects to the open flowers, where they infect the developing fruits and cause them to shrivel and drop1. The fungus can infect different cultivars of blueberries with varying degrees of susceptibility. It can also infect other plants in the Ericaceae family, such as cranberry, rhododendron, and azalea. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of iron deficiency in blueberries are not clear, as there is no evidence of bacterial infection associated with this condition. However, some bacteria that can cause diseases on blueberries are Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, which causes bacterial canker2, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which causes crown gall2. These bacteria can infect through wounds or natural openings on the stems or roots, causing galls, cankers, dieback, or reduced growth2. Some possible targets for these bacteria are genes involved in plant defense, cell wall synthesis, or hormone signaling.
