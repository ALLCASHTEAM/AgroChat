Blueberries are a horticultural crop that are grown for their edible fruits1 2. Red ringspot virus disease of blueberries is a viral disease caused by the blueberry red ringspot virus (BRRV)3 4.
The blueberry red ringspot virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Nepovirus and the family Secoviridae4. It does not have a fungal pathogen associated with it, so it does not have a mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus. The blueberry red ringspot virus is transmitted by grafting and by nematodes of the genus Xiphinema1 5. It is not airborne or insect-borne.
The period of disease onset for red ringspot virus disease of blueberries varies depending on the cultivar, environmental conditions and virus strain. Symptoms may appear as early as one year after infection or as late as five years after infection1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are not well understood, but it seems that the virus prefers cool and moist climates1 2. The disease is more severe in acidic soils and in plants with low nitrogen levels2.
The overwintering method of the disease is through the nematode vectors that survive in the soil and infect new roots in the spring1 4. The virus may also persist in infected plant tissues that remain alive during winter2.
There is no chemical control available for this viral disease1.
Infected plants should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent further spread of the virus1. Pruning of infected stems may reduce symptoms but will not eliminate the virus from the plant2.
There is no biological control available for this viral disease1.
The best way to prevent this disease is to use virus-free planting material and avoid grafting susceptible cultivars onto infected rootstocks1. Weed control and insect control may also help reduce the potential vectors of the virus2.
["The most characteristic symptom of this disease is the appearance of red ringspots on the stems, leaves, and ripening fruit of infected plants3 4. The ringspots are usually circular or oval, 1 to 5 mm in diameter, and may have a yellow halo around them2 1. The ringspots may coalesce and form larger lesions on the stems and leaves2.", "The disease may also cause stunting, reduced vigor, leaf drop, and reduced yield and fruit quality in severely infected plants2 1. The fruit may become malformed, cracked, or shriveled2."]
["The disease signs of this disease are not visible to the naked eye, as the virus is microscopic and resides inside the plant cells1. The only way to confirm the presence of the virus is by using molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)3 4.", "[[1]:([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30764382/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30764382/))]", "[[2]:([https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/PP348](https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/PP348))]", "[[3]:([https://ucanr.edu/sites/natcpn/files/305902.pdf](https://ucanr.edu/sites/natcpn/files/305902.pdf))]", "[[4]:([https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS-93-7-0727](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS-93-7-0727))]", "[[5]:([https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PDIS-04-15-0381-RE](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PDIS-04-15-0381-RE))]"]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some studies have suggested that Colletotrichum acutatum and Botrytis cinerea are resistant to some fungicides1. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the target site, overexpression of efflux pumps, or degradation of fungicides1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide and the fungal strain1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not available, but some molecular methods have been developed for the detection and discrimination of Blueberry red ringspot virus (BRRV), which causes red ringspots on the stems, leaves, and ripening fruit of infected highbush blueberry plants2 3. These methods include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and real-time PCR (qPCR)3. These methods can detect BRRV in different plant tissues and at different stages of infection3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but some studies have suggested that BRRV belongs to the genus Nepovirus in the family Secoviridae2 3. Nepoviruses have a bipartite RNA genome that encodes several proteins, including coat protein (CP), movement protein (MP), and replication-associated proteins (RPs)3. These proteins may play a role in the infection and movement of BRRV within and between host plants3. BRRV can infect different species of Vaccinium, such as highbush blueberry, lowbush blueberry, and cranberry4. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not known, but some studies have suggested that BRRV can reduce the yield and fruit quality of infected blueberry plants5. BRRV can cause reduced berry size, reduced soluble solids content, and increased titratable acidity in some cultivars5. BRRV can also cause premature fruit drop and reduced fruit set in some cases5. Therefore, genes involved in these processes may be potential targets for BRRV infection.
