Blueberry is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruits1. Blueberry leaf spot disease can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as fungal, bacterial, or viral agents2. Some of the common fungal leaf spot diseases are anthracnose, septoria, double spot, gloeocercospora, and leaf rust1 3 4. Bacterial leaf scorch is another leaf spot disease that affects blueberry plants2. Exobasidium leaf and fruit spot is a viral disease that infects both leaves and berries of blueberry5.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of blueberry leaf spot disease depends on the type of fungus. For example, anthracnose fungus produces conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by rain or wind1. Leaf rust fungus produces aeciospores (sexual spores) and urediniospores (asexual spores) that are airborne and infect blueberry leaves4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of blueberry leaf spot disease also vary depending on the type of pathogen. Most leaf spot diseases are favored by wet and humid conditions that facilitate spore germination and infection6. Some pathogens overwinter in infected leaves or stems on the ground and are splashed by rain to new plants1 3. Some pathogens can also infect fruit or buds and cause secondary infections on stems or leaves1 5.
The period of disease onset for blueberry leaf spot disease depends on the type of pathogen and the environmental conditions. Some pathogens can infect newly expanded leaves or flowers in spring, while others can infect mature leaves in mid- or late-summer1 4 5. Symptoms may appear as early as three days after infection or as late as four weeks after infection1. The environmental conditions required for blueberry leaf spot disease are mostly wet and humid weather that provides moisture for spore germination and infection1. Temperature ranges may vary depending on the type of pathogen, but generally moderate to warm temperatures are conducive for disease development1 3 4 5. Soil conditions may also affect the susceptibility of blueberry plants to some leaf spot diseases, such as anthracnose, which is more severe on acidic soils1.
The overwintering method of blueberry leaf spot disease depends on the type of pathogen. Some pathogens overwinter in infected leaves or stems on the ground, while others overwinter on the surface of stems or buds1 4 5. Some pathogens may also survive in alternative hosts, such as hemlock trees for leaf rust fungus4.
Fungicides can be applied to protect the foliage from infection or to reduce the spread of the disease. The type of fungicide, application dose, application period, application frequency, and control effect depend on the specific product label and the disease situation. Some examples of fungicides that can be used for blueberry leaf spot diseases are captan, chlorothalonil, fenbuconazole, mancozeb, propiconazole, pyraclostrobin, and thiophanate-methyl.
Infected leaves and stems can be pruned and removed from the field to reduce the inoculum source. This can also improve air circulation and sunlight penetration in the canopy, which can reduce the humidity and favor disease development.
There are no commercially available biological control agents for blueberry leaf spot diseases. However, some natural enemies of the fungal pathogens may exist in the environment and help suppress the disease.
Cultural practices such as planting resistant cultivars, avoiding overhead irrigation, maintaining optimal soil pH and fertility, and rotating crops can help prevent or reduce blueberry leaf spot diseases.
["Anthracnose: Small reddish flecks on young leaves and stems; large brown to gray lesions on leaves with a dark border; stem lesions that are dark red, circular to elliptical, and can cause dieback.", "Septoria: Small spots on leaves with a white to tan center and a purple border; black fungal fruiting bodies in the center of lesions; stem lesions that are flat or slightly sunken with a tan to gray center and a reddish brown margin.", "Double spot: Small spots on leaves that enlarge in late summer; secondary necrotic area around the original spot spreading in an irregular to fan-shaped pattern; dark border surrounding the original spot persists.", "Gloeocercospora: Small to medium dark brown, circular to angular lesions on leaves surrounded by a dark border; no fungal fruiting bodies visible.", "Leaf rust: Pale green spots on the upper surface of leaves with yellow-orange pustules on the lower surface; pustules release powdery spores that can re-infect leaves; severe infections can cause premature leaf drop.", "Exobasidium: Pale green spots on the upper surface of leaves with pure white fungal growth on the lower surface; infected flowers produce malformed berries that are pale green or pinkish-red with white fungal growth."]
["Anthracnose: Black fungal fruiting bodies (acervuli) that produce spores (conidia) on leaf and stem lesions; spores are hyaline, cylindrical, and have one or two septa.", "Septoria: Black fungal fruiting bodies (pycnidia) that produce spores (conidia) in the center of leaf and stem lesions; spores are hyaline, cylindrical, and have several septa.", "Double spot: Black fungal fruiting bodies (pycnidia) that produce spores (conidia) in the original spot; spores are hyaline, cylindrical, and have several septa.", "Gloeocercospora: No fungal fruiting bodies visible; spores (conidia) are produced in slimy masses on leaf lesions; spores are hyaline, curved, and have several septa.", "Leaf rust: Yellow-orange pustules (uredinia) that produce spores (urediniospores) on the lower surface of leaves; spores are yellow-orange, oval, and have thick walls with echinulations.", "Exobasidium: White fungal growth (basidiospores) on the lower surface of leaves and infected berries; spores are hyaline, cylindrical, and have four sterigmata."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of blueberry leaf spot disease depends on the type of fungus and the cultivar of blueberry. According to one study1, Gloeosporium minus (the causal agent of anthracnose) showed resistance to benzimidazole fungicides such as thiophanate-methyl and benomyl, while Septoria albopunctata (the causal agent of septoria leaf spot) was sensitive to these fungicides. Another study2 found that Exobasidium maculosum (the causal agent of exobasidium leaf and fruit spot) was resistant to captan, a commonly used fungicide for blueberry diseases. The level of resistance may vary depending on the strain of the fungus and the environmental conditions. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the target site of the fungicide, degradation or detoxification of the fungicide by the fungus, or reduced uptake or increased efflux of the fungicide by the fungus3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of blueberry leaf spot disease is to use a microscope to examine the spores and mycelium of the fungus on the infected leaves or fruits. The spores and mycelium have distinctive shapes and sizes that can help identify the type of fungus. For example, Gloeosporium minus produces dark brown, oval-shaped spores with a single septum (division) in each spore4. Septoria albopunctata produces small black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) that contain hyaline (clear), needle-shaped spores with 3-5 septa5. Exobasidium maculosum produces banana-shaped to fusiform (spindle-shaped) spores that are 3-5 x 10-15 microns in size6. Another quick test method is to use a DNA-based assay such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the specific DNA sequences of the fungus in the infected tissue 
Most blueberry leaf spot diseases are caused by plant pathogenic fungi. In addition to causing leaf spots, some leaf-infecting pathogens can also infect fruit. For example, Gloeosporium Leaf Spot or Anthracnose (Gloeosporium minus) can produce flecking, leaf anthracnose, and stem lesions. Gloeosporium leaf spot was first described as a stem and leaf fleck disease of blueberry. Symptoms first appear as small reddish flecks on young leaves and stems of succulent shoots. Leaf and stem flecks do not develop further. The leaf anthracnose stage produces large (1/2 to over 1 inch across) brown to gray lesions that are the most common symptom observed in the field. Development of lesions results primarily from infection through hydathodes at the margins of the leaf, and to a lesser extent through wounds. Secondary stem lesions can develop from leaf infections by growing through the petiole into the stem, and from bud infections late in the season. Stem lesions first appear on current seasonвЂ™s growth as dark red circular to elliptical lesions around leaf scars. As the lesions enlarge, the affected stems turn brown and eventually become gray and die. On highly susceptible cultivars such as Duke, Jersey, and Pender, the disease can result in severe dieback 2.
