The type of crop of chinar (Platanus orientalis) is a horticultural crop. It is a deciduous tree that is grown for its ornamental value, shade, and timber1. The type of disease that causes leaf spot on chinar is a fungal disease. The causal agent is Colletotrichum species, which are common pathogens of many plants2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of the disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in acervuli (small, cushion-like structures) on the infected leaves2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of the disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and leaf wetness. The fungus can survive on fallen leaves and infect new leaves through rain splash or wind dispersal of conidia3 4.
The period of time during which the disease occurs is mainly in the spring and summer seasons, when the weather is warm and humid and the new leaves are emerging2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30Г‚В°C), high humidity (\&gt;80%), and prolonged leaf wetness (\&gt;12 hours). These conditions favor the germination of conidia and the infection of leaves2 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on fallen leaves or in plant debris on the ground. The fungus can also form sclerotia (hardened masses of fungal tissue) that can withstand unfavorable conditions and resume growth when conditions improve2 4.
Fungicides such as flusilazole and benzoxystrobin can be effective in reducing the severity and incidence of the disease. Flusilazole is more suitable for controlling leaf spot disease in the field, and benzoxystrobin can be used as an alternative fungicide1. The application dose, period, frequency, and effectiveness of these fungicides may vary depending on the product label, environmental conditions, and disease pressure. Always follow the label instructions and safety precautions when using fungicides.
Removing and destroying infected leaves and plant debris can help reduce the inoculum source and prevent the spread of the disease. Pruning and thinning the canopy can improve air circulation and reduce leaf wetness, which are favorable for fungal infection2.
There are no specific biological agents that are known to control chinar leaf spot disease. However, some general biocontrol agents such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, and Pseudomonas fluorescens may have some antagonistic effects on the pathogen or induce systemic resistance in the plant3. These agents can be applied as foliar sprays or soil drenches, but their efficacy may depend on various factors such as compatibility with other treatments, environmental conditions, and disease pressure.
Planting resistant or tolerant cultivars of chinar can reduce the susceptibility to leaf spot disease. Avoiding overhead irrigation and using drip irrigation can minimize leaf wetness and fungal dispersal. Applying balanced fertilization and maintaining optimal soil pH can enhance plant health and resistance2.
["Dark brown to black spots on the leaves, often with a yellow halo around them. The spots may coalesce and form large blotches that cover most of the leaf surface2.", "Premature defoliation of infected leaves, especially during severe infections. This can reduce the ornamental value and photosynthetic capacity of the plant2.", "Reduced growth and vigor of the plant due to loss of foliage and reduced photosynthesis2."]
["Acervuli (small, cushion-like structures) that produce conidia (asexual spores) on the surface of infected leaves. The acervuli are black and have hair-like appendages called setae that radiate from them2.", "Conidia (asexual spores) that are hyaline (transparent), cylindrical, and have one or more septa (cross-walls) dividing them into cells. The conidia are dispersed by rain splash or wind to new leaves or plants2.", "Sclerotia (hardened masses of fungal tissue) that may form on infected leaves or plant debris. The sclerotia are black, irregular in shape, and can survive unfavorable conditions such as winter or drought. They can resume growth and produce conidia when conditions improve2."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus may develop resistance to fungicides by altering the target site of the fungicide, increasing the expression or activity of detoxification enzymes, or reducing the uptake or translocation of the fungicide1. Type of resistance agent: The fungus may develop resistance to different classes of fungicides, such as demethylation inhibitors (DMIs), quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs)1. Level of resistance: The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide class, the fungal population, and the environmental conditions. Some studies have reported moderate to high levels of resistance to QoIs and SDHIs in Colletotrichum species causing leaf spot diseases in various crops2 3. However, there is limited information on the level of resistance to fungicides in Colletotrichum species causing chinar leaf spot disease. 
One possible quick test for the fungus is to use a lactophenol cotton blue stain to observe the morphology and characteristics of the fungal structures under a microscope. This stain can help differentiate Colletotrichum species from other fungi by showing their acervuli, setae, conidia, and sclerotia. Another possible quick test for the fungus is to use a molecular diagnostic method such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the specific DNA sequences of the fungus in infected plant samples. These methods can help identify Colletotrichum species from other fungi by amplifying their unique genetic markers. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus may produce various types of pathogenic effectors that can manipulate the host defense responses and facilitate infection. Some examples of these effectors are cutinases, pectinases, cellulases, proteases, lipases, glucanases, and necrosis-inducing proteins. The number and diversity of these effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain, the host plant, and the environmental conditions. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus may show different levels of infestation or host specificity depending on the plant species or cultivar. Some plants may have innate or acquired resistance to the fungus, while others may be more susceptible or tolerant. Some factors that may influence the infestation of different plants are plant genotype, plant age, plant health, plant hormones, and plant metabolites. 
One possible target of the fungus is its cell wall biosynthesis pathway, which is essential for its growth, development, and virulence. Inhibiting this pathway may impair the fungal cell wall integrity and function, leading to reduced infection and increased susceptibility to host defenses or fungicides. Another possible target of the fungus is its mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is involved in its energy production, metabolism, and stress response. Inhibiting this chain may disrupt the fungal cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to reduced survival and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress or fungicides.
