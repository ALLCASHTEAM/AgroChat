Citrus plants are a type of horticultural crop, which means they are grown for their fruits, flowers, or ornamental value1. Citrus greening disease is a type of bacterial disease, caused by a bacterium called Candidatus Liberibacter spp.2 3.
The pathogenic bacterium of this disease does not have a fungal origin, so it does not have a mode of reproduction typical of fungi. However, it can multiply inside the cells of the plant and the insect vector2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by the presence and activity of the insect vector, which is the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) or the African citrus psyllid (Trioza erytreae)4 3. These insects feed on the phloem sap of citrus plants and transmit the bacterium from infected to healthy plants. The disease can also be spread by grafting infected plant material2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions, the citrus variety, and the inoculum level. It can range from a few months to several years after infection2. Symptoms usually appear first on young leaves and shoots, and then spread to older branches and fruits3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are those that favor the development and survival of the insect vector and the bacterium. These include warm and humid climates, abundant rainfall, and high nitrogen levels in the soil2 3. The disease is more severe in regions with year-round citrus production than in regions with seasonal production2.
The overwintering method of this disease is not well understood, but it is likely that the bacterium survives in the plant tissues and the insect vector during cold or dry periods. The insect vector may also migrate to warmer or wetter areas where citrus plants are available2 3.
This involves the use of insecticides to reduce the population and activity of the insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid. Systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid and thiamethoxam can be applied to the soil or through irrigation systems, while foliar insecticides such as fenpropathrin, abamectin, and spinetoram can be sprayed on the leaves1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label, the citrus variety, and the pest pressure. The control effect of chemical control is variable and may not prevent infection completely1.
This involves the removal and destruction of infected plants or plant parts to reduce the inoculum source and slow down the spread of the disease1 3. This requires frequent scouting and identification of symptomatic trees or shoots, which can be done by visual inspection or molecular tests1. Physical measures may also include the use of protective barriers such as screens or covers to exclude the insect vector from the plants1.
This involves the use of natural enemies such as predators, parasitoids, or pathogens to suppress the population and activity of the insect vector1 4. Some examples of biological control agents include lady beetles, lacewings, hover flies, parasitic wasps, and entomopathogenic fungi1 4. Biological control can be enhanced by conserving or augmenting the natural enemies in the field, or by releasing them at appropriate times and locations1 4.
This involves the use of cultural practices such as irrigation, fertilization, pruning, mulching, and intercropping to improve the health and vigor of the plants and reduce their susceptibility to the disease1 3. Agricultural control may also include the use of resistant or tolerant citrus varieties or rootstocks, if available1 3.

Citrus greening is caused by a bacterial pathogen, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), which is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP)1 2. It is not caused by a phytopathogenic fungus, so I cannot provide you with the resistance of such a fungus. However, I can tell you that there is no cure for this disease and all commercial varieties of citrus are susceptible to HLB1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease does not exist, since the disease is not fungal. However, there are some methods to detect the presence of CLas in citrus plants, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and antibody-based assays2 3. These methods require laboratory equipment and trained personnel, and may not be very accurate or sensitive3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not well understood, since the disease is not fungal. However, some studies have suggested that CLas may invade and multiply in the phloem tissue of citrus plants, causing plugging and disruption of the nutrient transport system3. CLas may also produce toxins that affect plant metabolism and physiology3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors of CLas are not known, but some candidates have been identified by genomic analysis3. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host susceptibility, environmental factors, and vector population dynamics2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are also not well understood, since the disease is not fungal. However, some studies have suggested that CLas may affect the expression of various genes involved in defense, stress response, photosynthesis, cell wall modification, and secondary metabolism in citrus plants3. Knockout lethal genes of CLas are not known, but some candidates have been identified by genomic analysis3.
