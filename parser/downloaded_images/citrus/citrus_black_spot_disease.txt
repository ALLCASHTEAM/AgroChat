Citrus black spot affects citrus plants, which are horticultural crops that are grown for their fruits and ornamental values1. Citrus fruits are rich in vitamin C and other nutrients and have various uses in food, medicine, and industry1. Citrus black spot is a fungal disease caused by <em>Phyllosticta citricarpa</em> (previously known as <em>Guignardia citricarpa</em>), which belongs to the Ascomycota phylum2. The fungus infects the fruit rind and causes lesions that reduce the fruit quality and marketability2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by both asexual and sexual spores. The asexual spores are called conidia, which are produced in small, black structures called conidiomata on the fruit lesions or on fallen leaves2. The sexual spores are called ascospores, which are produced in flask-shaped structures called perithecia that are embedded in the leaf litter3. The conidia are dispersed by wind or rain and can infect new fruits or leaves. The ascospores are released when the leaf litter is wetted and can also infect new hosts3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by several factors, such as the host susceptibility, the environmental conditions, and the inoculum sources. The disease is more severe on late-maturing cultivars, such as Valencia oranges and grapefruits, than on early-maturing cultivars, such as Navel oranges and mandarins2. The disease is also more prevalent in humid and warm climates, where frequent rainfall or irrigation provides favorable conditions for spore germination and infection2. The disease can spread within and between orchards by wind-blown or rain-splashed conidia, or by contaminated tools, equipment, or plant material2. The disease can also overwinter as conidia or ascospores in the leaf litter or on the fruit rind2.
The period of onset of the disease depends on the stage of fruit development and the environmental conditions. The fungus can infect young fruits soon after petal fall, but the symptoms may not appear until several months later when the fruits mature2. The symptoms usually appear as small, round, dark spots with yellow halos on the fruit rind. As the disease progresses, the spots may enlarge and coalesce, forming irregular patches of necrotic tissue. The spots may also crack or become corky, exposing the underlying tissue to secondary infections2. The environmental conditions required for this disease are high humidity and moderate to warm temperatures. The fungus can grow optimally between 20В°C and 30В°C, and requires at least 6 hours of wetness per day for infection2. The disease is more severe in areas with frequent rainfall or irrigation, especially during fruit development and maturation2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by survival of the fungus in infected tissues or plant debris. The fungus can overwinter as conidia or ascospores in the leaf litter or on the fruit rind. The spores can germinate and infect new hosts when conditions become favorable2.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of citrus black spot is mainly due to the production of ascospores, which are sexual spores that can survive in the leaf litter for long periods and germinate under favorable conditions1. The fungus also has a high genetic diversity and can adapt to different environmental and host factors2. The level of resistance depends on the cultivar, the climate, and the management practices3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of citrus black spot is the PCR-based assay that can detect the presence of the fungus in symptomatic and asymptomatic fruit and leaves4. This method is more sensitive and specific than the traditional methods based on culturing and microscopy4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of citrus black spot is not fully understood, but it involves the infection of young fruit and leaves by ascospores or conidia (asexual spores) that penetrate through natural openings or wounds3. The fungus then colonizes the host tissue and produces lesions that contain more spores3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors that the fungus secretes to manipulate the host defense are unknown, but some candidates have been identified by genomic and transcriptomic analyses2. The differences in infestation of different plants are related to the susceptibility of different cultivars, which may vary in their anatomical, physiological, and biochemical characteristics3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of citrus black spot are not clear, as there is no evidence that bacteria are involved in this disease. However, some studies have suggested that endophytic bacteria may play a role in enhancing or reducing the severity of citrus black spot by producing antifungal compounds or inducing systemic resistance in the host plants.
