Onion is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible bulbs and leaves1. Onion downy mildew is an oomycete disease caused by the fungus-like organism Peronospora destructor1 2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of onion downy mildew reproduces by producing spores that are dispersed by wind or water2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of onion downy mildew are influenced by environmental conditions, especially temperature, humidity and rainfall. The disease is more severe in cool wet seasons and in wet areas, and less likely to occur in warmer climates4 2. The spores can infect the leaves and bulbs of onion plants directly or through wounds2.
The period of disease onset for onion downy mildew varies depending on the weather and the susceptibility of the onion cultivar. The disease can appear as early as late spring or as late as mid-summer1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity (above 90%) and cool temperatures (4-25В°C) at night, followed by warm days1 2. The disease is also favored by wet soils and overcrowded crops1.
The overwintering method of onion downy mildew is mainly by surviving as mycelium in infected onion bulbs or debris that remain in the field or nearby cull piles2. The fungus can also overwinter in perennial onions such as chives in home gardens2. It is possible that some spores may persist in the soil and infect the roots of young onion plants in the spring2.
Using fungicides such as dithiocarbamate1 or nanosilica mixed with fungicides2 at the first sign of infection or as a preventive measure. The type, dose, period and number of applications may vary depending on the product and the disease severity. The control effect may also depend on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the cultivar.
Removing and disposing of infected plants, seeds, bulbs and plant debris1 3 to prevent the spread of the disease and reduce the inoculum in the soil. Avoiding overcrowded crops, damp conditions and sheltered sites3 to ensure airflow and reduce humidity.
No biological control agents are available for onion downy mildew.
Using resistant cultivars such as 'Hylander' and 'Santero'3 or experimental cultivars4 that show some tolerance to the disease. Rotating crops with non-host plants for at least five years3 to break the disease cycle. Planting onion sets for over-wintering in late September3 to avoid early infection.
["Leaf yellowing and dieback from the tip downwards1 3, resulting in reduced bulb size and quality1.", "Premature sprouting or shriveling of bulbs in storage1."]
["White and later purplish mould developing on affected parts of the leaf and stalk in moist conditions1 3. This is the spore-producing structure of the pathogen.", "Darker mould growth of other leaf-colonising fungi on dead tissue1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well understood, but some studies have suggested that it may involve quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that confer partial resistance to different isolates of Peronospora destructor1. The type of resistance agent is not clear, but it may be related to plant defense responses such as phenolic compounds, antioxidant enzymes and pathogenesis-related proteins2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the onion cultivar, the pathogen isolate and the environmental conditions1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that can detect the presence of Peronospora destructor DNA in onion tissue samples within 30 minutes3. This method is based on the amplification of a specific region of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the fungal ribosomal DNA using four primers and a DNA polymerase under isothermal conditions3. The LAMP assay can be performed in a simple water bath or heating block and the results can be visualized by adding a fluorescent dye or observing turbidity3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully elucidated, but it may involve the secretion of effector proteins by the fungus that modulate the host plant immunity and facilitate infection4. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but some candidates have been identified by comparative genomics and transcriptomics approaches4. Differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the specificity and recognition of the effector proteins by the plant receptors and the subsequent activation or suppression of defense signaling pathways4. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are also unknown, but some studies have suggested that they may include genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, photosynthesis, redox homeostasis, hormone metabolism and defense responses2 4. Knockout lethal genes are those that are essential for the survival or growth of the fungus and may be exploited as targets for disease control. However, no such genes have been reported for Peronospora destructor so far.
