Onion is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family <em>Alliaceae</em>1.. Sclerotium diseases are caused by fungi (<em>Stromatinia cepivora, Sclerotium rolfsii</em>) that produce hard, dormant structures called sclerotia. These sclerotia can survive in the soil for many years, and can infect onion plants when conditions are favorable. For example: White rot, Pink root rot and Basal rot.

Sclerotium disorders are particularly prevalent in chilly, damp environments. The ideal temperature for disease development is between 50 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Sclerotia may also live in hot, dry environments, although disease development is slower.2. TThe disease is more prevalent in regions with warm and humid climate, such as South Africa, India, Brazil, and Iran2.
The overwintering method of this disease is not well known, but it is possible that the bacterium survives in infected plant debris, soil, or weeds, or in alternative hosts such as grasses or weeds2. The vector leafhoppers may also overwinter on these plants and transmit the bacterium to onion plants in the next season2.
Fungicides such as procymidone can reduce the incidence of onion white rot, which is caused by a related pathogen, <em>Sclerotium cepivorum1</em> 2. The recommended dose and application period may vary depending on the product label and local regulations. most effective fungicides for controlling sclerotium diseases in onions: Iprodione:В This fungicide is also effective against a wide range of sclerotium diseases. Vinzoclon:В This fungicide is effective against white rot and pink root rot. And Folicur:В This fungicide is effective against white rot and basal rot.
One possible physical measure is to cut off infected parts of the onion bulbs and discard them properly to prevent further spread of the disease3. However, this may not be feasible or effective for large-scale production or storage. Heat treatment:В Heat treatment can be used to kill sclerotia in the soil. This can be done by solarizing the soil or by using a hot water treatment.
Some fungal antagonists such as <em>Chaetomium globosum, Coniothyrium minitans, Trichoderma harzianum</em>, <em>T. koningii</em>, and <em>T. virens</em> have been shown to inhibit the growth of Sclerotium cepivorum in glasshouse trials2. These fungi can be applied as soil additives at the time of planting or before planting to reduce the disease incidence2 3. However, their efficacy and stability in field conditions are not well established and may depend on environmental factors and inoculum sources2.
Some agricultural practices that can help prevent or reduce onion microbacterium nodosum disease are:Crop rotation: Avoid planting onion or related crops (such as garlic, leek, chive) in the same field for at least four years to reduce the soil inoculum level3.Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris and cull bulbs after harvest and during storage to avoid contamination of healthy bulbs3.Irrigation: Avoid excessive irrigation or waterlogging that can favor the development and spread of the disease3.Fertility: Maintain optimal soil fertility and pH levels to enhance plant growth and resistance to disease3.Cultivar selection: Choose onion cultivars that are less susceptible or tolerant to onion white rot or other bacterial diseases3.
["The main symptom of onion microbacterium nodosum disease is bulb rot, which can occur during growth or storage4 5. The infected bulbs become soft, watery, and foul-smelling, and may have a brownish discoloration of the inner scales4 5. The rot may start from the neck or the base of the bulb, or from any wound or injury site4 5.", "Another symptom that may occur during growth is leaf blight, which causes yellowing, wilting, and dying of the foliage4 5. The leaf blight may be confused with other fungal or bacterial diseases that affect onion leaves4 5."]
["The main sign of onion microbacterium nodosum disease is the presence of bacterial colonies on the surface or inside the infected bulbs4 5. The bacteria are gram-positive, rod-shaped, and non-spore-forming, and can be isolated and cultured on artificial media4 5.", "Another sign that may be observed is the formation of white mycelia or black sclerotia of Sclerotium cepivorum on or near the infected bulbs2 3. This indicates a mixed infection with onion white rot, which is caused by this fungal pathogen that can coexist with onion microbacterium nodosum in the soil2 3.", "The resistance of the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is not well studied, but some studies have reported that it can be resistant to copper-based bactericides, which are commonly used to control bacterial diseases in plants. The mechanism of resistance may involve the efflux of copper ions from the bacterial cells or the expression of copper-binding proteins that reduce the toxicity of copper.", "A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which is a molecular technique that can detect the presence of the bacterium's DNA in plant samples within an hour. The LAMP assay is simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific, and can be performed in a field setting with minimal equipment.", "The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but it is likely that the bacterium uses type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the plant cells and manipulate their functions. The type and number of effector proteins are not known, but they may vary depending on the host plant and the environmental conditions. Some possible functions of the effector proteins are to suppress plant defense responses, alter plant hormone signaling, modulate plant metabolism, and induce cell death.", "The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease are not clear, but some studies have suggested that some genes involved in plant immunity, such as NPR1, PR1, and WRKY transcription factors, may be important for resistance to the bacterium. Knockout or silencing of these genes may increase the susceptibility of plants to the bacterium."]

Rapid detection can be done by PCRs and ITS gene segments.
