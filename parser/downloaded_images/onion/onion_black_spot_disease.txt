Onion is a type of horticultural crop1, which means it is grown for its edible parts such as bulbs, leaves, or flowers. The black spot disease of onion is caused by a fungal pathogen called <em>Aspergillus niger</em>1 2 3 4, which produces black spores on the infected parts of the onion.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that can be dispersed by air, water, or insects2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and moisture5. The fungus can infect onions through wounds or natural openings in the neck or outer scales1 4. The spores can also survive on plant debris or soil and infect new crops2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the conditions and the stage of onion development. The fungus can infect onions at any time during the growing season, but it is more common near maturity or after harvest1 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm temperatures (above 15В°C) and high humidity (above 85%)2. The fungus can grow faster and produce more spores under these conditions3. The disease can also be aggravated by poor ventilation, excessive irrigation, or improper storage1 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving as spores on plant debris or soil2. The spores can remain viable for several months and germinate when favorable conditions return3.
There are no fungicides for the direct control of black mold1. However, some fungicides used for foliar diseases may reduce the incidence of black mold1. For example, mancozeb can be applied at 1.5 kg/ha every 7 to 10 days from transplanting to bulb initiation.
Remove and destroy infected bulbs as soon as possible to prevent the spread of spores2 3. Avoid injuring bulbs during harvesting, handling, and storage1 3.
There is no information on biological control of black mold on onion.
Rotate crops with non-host plants for at least 3 years3. Avoid planting onions near grains, which can attract thrips that can damage onion leaves and create entry points for the fungus4. Plant cilantro around onions to repel spider mites, another potential vector of the fungus4. Harvest onions when the tops are dry and mature, and cure them properly before storage1 3. Store and transport onions at temperatures below 15Г‚В°C and at low humidity to slow the growth of the fungus1.
["The fungus causes black spots, streaks, patches, or sooty masses on the neck or outer scales of the onion bulb2 5 3. The spots may appear in a streaking pattern along veins2. The affected scales may become water-soaked and shrivel2 3. The fungus may also invade the interior parts of the bulb and cause gray-to-black discoloration without showing external symptoms2."]
["The fungus produces microscopic spores that are visible as a black sooty mass on the infected parts of the onion bulb2 5 3. The spores are easily dispersed by air, water, insects, or handling1 3."]
Resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease:I do not have enough information on this item. The search results did not provide any information on the mechanism of resistance, the type of resistance agent, or the level of resistance of the fungus Aspergillus niger that causes black spot disease of onion. 
Quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease:I do not have enough information on this item. The search results did not provide any information on a quick test method for the fungus <em>Aspergillus niger</em> that causes black spot disease of onion. 
Mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease: The fungus <em>Aspergillus niger</em> is a common cause of black spot disease of onions and other important cash crops. It is a weak pathogen that generally does not affect uninjured bulbs1. It enters the bulb through wounds, insect injuries, or root scars at the base2. It produces microscopic spores that are visible as a black sooty mass on the infected parts of the onion bulb1 3. The spores are easily dispersed by air, water, insects, or handling2 3. The fungus causes black spots, streaks, patches, or sooty masses on the neck or outer scales of the onion bulb1 3 4. The spots may appear in a streaking pattern along veins1. The affected scales may become water-soaked and shrivel1 3 4. The fungus may also invade the interior parts of the bulb and cause gray-to-black discoloration without showing external symptoms1.
