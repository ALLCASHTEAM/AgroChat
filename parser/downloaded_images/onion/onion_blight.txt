Onion is a type of horticultural crop1 that is grown for its edible bulb and leaves. Onion blight can be caused by different types of diseases, such as fungal, bacterial, or oomycete2 3. Some examples of onion blight are <em>Botrytis</em> leaf blight, <em>Stemphylium blight</em>, and downy mildew2 3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of onion blight depends on the type of fungus. For instance, <em>Botrytis squamosa</em>, the causal agent of <em>Botrytis</em> leaf blight, produces conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or water1. Stemphylium vesicarium, the causal agent of Stemphylium blight, also produces conidia that are spread by wind or rain2. Peronospora destructor, the causal agent of downy mildew, produces sporangia (asexual spores) that are released from the underside of infected leaves and carried by wind or water4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of onion blight also vary depending on the type of disease. Botrytis leaf blight is favored by warm and humid conditions, and the infection occurs through wounds or natural openings on the leaves1. <em>Stemphylium</em> blight is favored by wet and warm weather, and the infection occurs through leaf lesions or stomata5. Downy mildew is favored by cool and moist conditions, and the infection occurs when sporangia land on wet leaves4.
The period of disease onset for onion blight depends on environmental factors and the stage of plant growth. Botrytis leaf blight can occur at any time during the growing season, but it is more common in late summer or early fall when temperatures are between 68Г‚В°F and 86Г‚В°F (20Г‚В°C and 30Г‚В°C) and relative humidity is above 90%1. <em>Stemphylium </em>blight can occur from mid-summer to harvest when temperatures are between 77Г‚В°F and 86Г‚В°F (25Г‚В°C and 30Г‚В°C) and rainfall is frequent2. Downy mildew can occur from early spring to late fall when temperatures are below 68Г‚В°F (20Г‚В°C) and dew formation is frequent4. The environmental conditions required for onion blight are similar to those mentioned above for each type of disease. In general, onion blight thrives in high moisture and moderate temperature conditions that favor fungal or oomycete growth and spore germination1 2 4.
The overwintering method of onion blight depends on the type of pathogen. <em>Botrytis squamosa</em> can survive in infected plant debris or seeds for up to two years1. <em>Stemphylium vesicarium</em> can survive in infected plant debris, seeds, or volunteer plants for up to one year2. Peronospora destructor can survive in infected plant debris or seeds as oospores (sexual spores) for up to four years4.
Crop rotation: Avoid planting onion-family crops in the same area for at least 2-3 years to reduce the buildup of inoculum1 2 3.
Sanitation: Remove and destroy all onion plant debris and cull piles after harvest to eliminate potential sources of spores4 1 5 3.
Plant spacing and orientation: Plant onion rows following the direction of the prevailing wind and keep a good distance between plants to limit leaf wetness and improve air circulation1 5.
Fungicide application: Apply protective fungicides on a 7-10 day basis starting from mid-June until 7-14 days before harvest, depending on the label requirement. Use weather-based computer programs to schedule fungicide applications and avoid unnecessary sprays1 2 3.
["Botrytis leaf blight: Small white spots surrounded by green water-soaked tissue on the leaves, which later collapse and become tan colored. The spots may coalesce and cause dieback of the entire onion top2.", "Purple blotch: Small tan spots on the leaves, which expand rapidly and become sunken lesions with purple bands. The lesions may also coalesce and cause collapse of the entire top2."]
["Botrytis leaf blight: Dark brown or black spores of the fungus <em>Botrytis squamosa</em> on the leaf lesions, which can be seen with a hand lens or microscope2.", "Purple blotch: Dark brown or black spores of the fungus <em>Alternaria porri</em> on the leaf lesions, which can be seen with a hand lens or microscope2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the type of fungus and the type of resistance agent. For example, <em>Botrytis squamosa</em>, the causal agent of Botrytis leaf blight, has been reported to develop resistance to benzimidazole and dicarboximide fungicides1. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the beta-tubulin and BcOS1 genes, respectively2. The level of resistance varies depending on the fungal isolate and the fungicide dose2. <em>Stemphylium vesicarium</em>, the causal agent of Stemphylium blight, has been reported to develop resistance to QoI (quinone outside inhibitor) fungicides3. The mechanism of resistance involves a mutation in the cytochrome b gene that confers cross-resistance to all QoI fungicides3. The level of resistance is high and stable3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the type of fungus and the availability of diagnostic tools. For example, <em>Botrytis squamosa</em> can be detected by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that amplifies a specific region of the fungal DNA. This method requires DNA extraction, PCR reagents, and a thermocycler. <em>Stemphylium vesicarium</em> can be detected by using a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that uses antibodies to capture fungal antigens. This method requires a LFIA device and a sample of infected tissue or spores. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease depends on the type of fungus and the type and number of pathogenic effectors. For example, <em>Botrytis squamosa </em>infects onion leaves through wounds or natural openings and produces various effectors that facilitate colonization and suppress host defense. Some of these effectors are necrotrophic toxins, such as botcinic acid and botrydial, that kill plant cells and degrade cell walls. Other effectors are secreted proteins, such as BcSpl1 and BcIEB1, that interfere with plant signaling pathways and immune responses. The number of effectors produced by <em>Botrytis squamosa</em> is estimated to be over 1000. <em>Stemphylium vesicarium</em> infects onion leaves through leaf lesions or stomata and produces various effectors that facilitate colonization and suppress host defense. Some of these effectors are necrotrophic toxins, such as stempholone and stemphyperylenol, that kill plant cells and degrade cell walls. Other effectors are secreted proteins, such as SvpelB1 and SvpelD1, that interfere with plant signaling pathways and immune responses. The number of effectors produced by Stemphylium vesicarium is estimated to be over 500. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease depend on the type of bacteria and the availability of genomic data. For example, <em>Xanthomonas axonopodis </em>pv. <em>allii</em>, the causal agent of bacterial blight, infects onion leaves through wounds or natural openings and injects various effectors into plant cells using a type III secretion system (T3SS). Some of these effectors are transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors, such as AvrXa7 and AvrXa10, that bind to specific DNA sequences in plant promoters and activate or repress gene expression. Other effectors are type III secreted proteins (T3SPs), such as XopD and XopJ, that modulate plant signaling pathways and immune responses. The number of effectors injected by <em>Xanthomonas axonopodis</em> pv. <em>allii </em>is estimated to be over 20. The potential targets of these effectors can be identified by using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptome analysis, or reverse genetics approaches. Some examples of potential targets are genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis
