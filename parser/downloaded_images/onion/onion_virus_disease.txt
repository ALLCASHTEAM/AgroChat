Onion is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Alliaceae1. Onion virus disease is a term that encompasses several viral infections that affect onion and other Allium species. One of the most common and destructive viruses is Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV), which is a viral disease caused by a potyvirus2 3 1.
The pathogenic virus of IYSV does not have a fungus associated with it, so it does not have a mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus. However, the virus itself replicates inside the host plant cells using its RNA genome and coat protein2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of IYSV is influenced by the presence and activity of its vector, the onion thrips (Thrips tabaci), which is a small insect that feeds on onion leaves and flowers. The thrips acquire the virus from infected plants and transmit it to healthy plants when they feed. The virus can also be transmitted through infected bulbs and sets during vegetative propagation4 2.
The period of disease onset for IYSV depends on the time of infection and the environmental conditions. Generally, symptoms appear two to four weeks after infection, but they can be delayed or masked by other factors such as plant stress or nutrient deficiency2. Symptoms include yellow or straw-colored lesions on the leaves and flower stalks, which are often diamond-shaped or elongated. The lesions can coalesce and cause premature senescence and death of the leaves, reducing photosynthesis.
The virus mainly adsorbs on bulbs or overwinters in the field with diseased remains.
There is no cure for onion virus disease once a plant is infected, so prevention is the best strategy1.
The most important control measure is to reduce the population of onion thrips, which are the main vectors of the virus1 2. This can be done by using insecticides, cultural practices (such as crop rotation, weed management, irrigation, and sanitation), and biological control agents (such as predatory mites and parasitic wasps)1 2.
Another control measure is to use virus-free seeds and transplants, and avoid planting onions near other hosts of the virus (such as iris, garlic, leek, and some weeds)1 2 3.
A third control measure is to monitor the onion fields regularly for symptoms and signs of the virus, and rogue out any infected plants as soon as possible1 2.
["The most characteristic symptom of onion virus disease is the appearance of yellow or straw-colored lesions on the leaves, often with concentric rings or diamond shapes1 2. These lesions can coalesce and cause premature senescence and death of the leaves1 2.", "The virus also affects the bulb development and quality, reducing the size, weight, and storability of the onions1 2.", "The virus can also cause stunting, wilting, and lodging (falling over) of the seed stalks, which reduces the seed production and viability1 2."]
["The physical evidence of the virus itself on the plant is not visible to the naked eye, but can be detected by molecular tests such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or PCR (polymerase chain reaction)1 2.", "The presence of onion thrips on the plants can also indicate a potential infection by the virus, as they are the main vectors of the virus1 2."]
As mentioned before, onion virus disease is not caused by a phytopathogenic fungus, but by a virus. Therefore, there is no information on the resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease. 
There is no quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease, since it is not a fungal disease. However, there are some methods to detect the presence of IYSV in onion plants, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)1. 
There is no information on the mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease, since it is not a fungal disease. However, some studies have suggested that IYSV may interfere with the host defense responses, such as salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathways, and induce the expression of genes related to cell wall modification and senescence1. 
There are no phytopathogenic bacteria associated with onion virus disease, so there is no information on the potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease. However, there are some bacterial diseases that can affect onion plants, such as sour skin, Enterobacter bulb decay, center rot and Rahnella rot2. These bacterial pathogens may have different virulence factors and host interactions that could be potential targets for disease management2.
