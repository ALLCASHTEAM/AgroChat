Mulberry is a horticultural crop that is cultivated for its leaves, which are used as food for silkworms1. Mulberry fungal leaf disease is a fungal disease caused by various pathogens, such as Cercospora moricola, Phyllosticta moricola, and Cerotelium fici1 2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungi of this disease varies depending on the species. For example, Cercospora moricola produces conidia that are dispersed by wind or rain1, while Cerotelium fici produces urediniospores and teliospores that are also wind-borne2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease also depend on the fungal species and the environmental conditions. Generally, the disease is more severe in humid and warm climates, and the spores are transmitted by airborne or rainsplash mechanisms1 2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the fungal species and the environmental conditions. Generally, the disease appears in the early spring or summer when the new leaves emerge and the temperature and humidity are favorable for spore germination and infection1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30Г‚В°C) and high humidity (80-90%) for spore germination and infection1 2. The disease also favors poor soil conditions, such as low fertility, acidity, or salinity1.
The overwintering method of this disease depends on the fungal species and the climatic conditions. Some fungi can survive on infected leaves that fall to the ground or on infected twigs that remain on the tree1. Some fungi can also form teliospores that can survive in the soil or on plant debris until favorable conditions return2.
Foliar spray of carbendazim and Mancozeb 70% WP in the ratio of 0.1% and 0.2% were most effective in reducing the disease1. Other fungicides such as copper oxychloride, chlorothalonil, and propiconazole can also be used2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the severity of the disease and the label instructions of the fungicides.
Pruning and burning of infected leaves and branches can reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease2 3. Sterilizing pruning tools can also prevent cross-contamination3.
Using plant extracts or biopesticides from plants such as Azadirachta indica, Carica papaya, Oscimum sanctum, Phyllanthus niruri, and Vitax nigundo can inhibit the growth of the pathogenic fungi and reduce the disease incidence1 4 5. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the efficacy and availability of the plant extracts or biopesticides.
Improving soil conditions, such as increasing fertility, pH, and drainage, can enhance the plant resistance and vigor2. Avoiding overhead irrigation and excessive nitrogen fertilization can reduce the humidity and susceptibility of the leaves2 3. Planting resistant or tolerant varieties can also reduce the disease severity2.
["Cercospora leaf spot: Small, circular to irregular, brown to black spots on both surfaces of the leaves. The spots may coalesce and cause premature leaf fall2 3.", "Phyllosticta leaf spot: Small, circular to angular, brown to black spots with gray centers on both surfaces of the leaves. The spots may have yellow halos and cause leaf distortion and defoliation2 3.", "Cerotelium leaf rust: Small, yellowish to orange pustules on the lower surface of the leaves. The pustules may rupture and release powdery spores that can infect other leaves. The upper surface of the leaves may show yellow spots or blotches. The infected leaves may curl, dry up, and fall off2 4 5."]
["Cercospora leaf spot: Dark brown to black conidia (asexual spores) that are cylindrical, curved, multi-septate, and borne in clusters on short stalks on the leaf surface2 3.", "Phyllosticta leaf spot: Dark brown to black pycnidia (fruiting bodies) that are globose, immersed in the leaf tissue, and produce hyaline (colorless), oval to oblong conidia that ooze out as a gelatinous mass2 3.", "Cerotelium leaf rust: Orange to brown urediniospores (asexual spores) that are globose to ellipsoidal, echinulate (spiny), and borne in pustules on the lower leaf surface; dark brown to black teliospores (sexual spores) that are two-celled, thick-walled, smooth, and borne in pustules on the lower leaf surface or on fallen leaves4 5."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is mainly related to the mechanism of detoxification of the fungicides applied by the farmers. The type of resistance agent depends on the type of fungicide used, such as benzimidazoles, strobilurins, or triazoles1 2. The level of resistance varies depending on the fungal species, the fungicide dose, and the frequency of application1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the specific DNA sequences of the fungus from the infected plant samples3 4. These methods are rapid, sensitive, and specific, and can be performed in a laboratory or in the field with portable devices3 4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is mainly related to the production and secretion of pathogenic effectors that can manipulate the plant defense responses and facilitate the fungal colonization and reproduction5. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the fungal species, but some common ones include cutinases, cellulases, pectinases, proteases, and lipases that can degrade the plant cell wall components; necrosis-inducing proteins, toxins, and enzymes that can cause cell death or damage; and small secreted proteins that can modulate the plant immune signaling pathways5. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility or specificity between the fungal effectors and the plant receptors or targets5. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease include plant resistance genes that can recognize the fungal effectors and trigger defense responses; plant hormone receptors that can regulate the plant stress responses; and plant metabolic enzymes that can affect the plant growth and development5. Some examples of knockout lethal genes are RPM1, RPS2, and RPS5 that encode resistance proteins against Pseudomonas syringae in Arabidopsis thaliana; ETR1 and ETR2 that encode ethylene receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana; and FAS1 and FAS2 that encode fatty acid synthase subunits in Arabidopsis thaliana.
