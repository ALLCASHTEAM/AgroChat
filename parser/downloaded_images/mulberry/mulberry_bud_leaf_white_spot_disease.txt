The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop1, as mulberry trees are grown for their attractive leaves and tasty fruits. The disease type of this disease is a fungal disease2, caused by the fungus <em>Mycosphaerella mori</em> (syn. <em>Phloeospora mori</em>).
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia2, which are asexual spores produced in tiny, brown-black fruiting bodies called <em>acervuli </em>on the leaf lesions. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are not clear, but it seems to be favored by wet weather3 and can spread by wind, rain, or infected plant debris.
The period of disease onset for this disease is in the late spring, when the first symptoms appear as small, dark brown and irregular leaf spots with pale-green yellow haloes2. The disease can progress throughout the summer and early autumn, causing premature defoliation and reduced fruit yield2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity and moderate temperature, as these favor the germination and infection of the conidia.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in young parts of branches, and in fallen leaves lying on the ground2. Good hygiene and sanitation can help prevent the recurrence of the disease in the future2.
Foliar spray of carbendazim and Mancozeb 70% WP in the ratio of 0.1% and 0.2% were reported to be most effective in reducing the disease1. However, synthetic fungicides may have residual effects and are not eco-friendly.
Pruning and disposing of the infected leaves and branches can help reduce the inoculum and prevent the spread of the disease2.
Some plant extracts, such as neem, garlic, ginger, turmeric, eucalyptus, and lemon grass, have shown antifungal properties against the pathogen and can be used as bio-pesticides1.
Planting resistant cultivars, such as some varieties of <em>Morus alba</em>, can help avoid the disease2. Maintaining good hygiene and sanitation, avoiding overhead irrigation, and providing adequate spacing and ventilation can also help prevent favorable conditions for the disease.
["Small, dark brown and irregular leaf spots with pale-green yellow haloes appear in the spring2.", "The spots increase in size, the centres becoming whitish and the haloes developing brown necrotic margins (dead edges)2.", "The leaves may crinkle and curl upward, and new shoots may have stunted growth3.", "The leaf spot lesions may merge to affect larger areas of the leaf2.", "Premature defoliation and reduced fruit yield may occur after severe attacks2."]
["Tiny, brownй€ҐжЏµlack, spore-producing fruiting bodies (<em>acervuli</em>) occur on the lesions2. These can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope.", "White powdery coating on the leaves, buds, and twigs may indicate powdery mildew, which is another fungal disease that can affect mulberry trees3."]
The ability to produce conidia that can survive in various environmental conditions and infect new hosts1. The ability to overwinter in young parts of branches and fallen leaves, which can serve as sources of inoculum2. The ability to adapt to different cultivars of mulberry and overcome their resistance mechanisms3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to examine the leaf lesions under a magnifying glass or a microscope and look for the presence of acervuli, which are tiny, brown-black fruiting bodies that produce conidia2. Alternatively, a laboratory test can be performed by isolating the fungus from the infected leaves and culturing it on a suitable medium, such as potato dextrose agar3. 
The conidia of the fungus are dispersed by wind, rain, or infected plant debris and land on the surface of the leaves1. The conidia germinate and produce germ tubes that penetrate the leaf cuticle and epidermis, either directly or through stomata1. The fungus colonizes the leaf tissues and produces hyphae that grow intercellularly and intracellularly, causing necrosis and chlorosis1. The fungus reproduces asexually by forming acervuli on the leaf lesions, which produce new conidia that can infect other leaves or plants1. 
Genes involved in plant defense responses, such as pathogenesis-related proteins, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and salicylic acid signaling3. Knocking out these genes may impair the plant's ability to resist or tolerate the infection. Genes involved in fungal virulence factors, such as cell wall-degrading enzymes, toxin production, and effector secretion4. Knocking out these genes may reduce the fungus's ability to invade or damage the plant tissues.
