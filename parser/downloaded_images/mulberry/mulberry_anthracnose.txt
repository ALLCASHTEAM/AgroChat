Mulberry is a horticultural crop that is cultivated for its leaves, which are used as food for silkworms1. Mulberry anthracnose is a fungal disease caused by different species of Colletotrichum, such as C. acutatum and C. dematium2 3 4.
The pathogenic fungi of Mulberry anthracnose reproduce by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or water2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of Mulberry anthracnose are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and leaf wetness. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions, and the conidia can infect the leaves through natural openings or wounds5 4. The disease can also spread through infected plant debris or pruning tools2.
The period of disease onset for Mulberry anthracnose varies depending on the climatic conditions and the susceptibility of the host plant. The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during the rainy season or when there is frequent irrigation2 4. The symptoms usually appear within 7 to 10 days after infection2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25 to 30Г‚В°C), high humidity (above 80%), and prolonged leaf wetness (more than 12 hours)2 4. The disease is less severe in dry and cool climates2.
The overwintering method of Mulberry anthracnose is not well documented, but it is likely that the fungus survives on infected plant debris or dormant buds, and produces conidia in the spring when the weather becomes favorable2 4.
Fungicides such as copper oxychloride, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, propiconazole, and difenoconazole can be applied to protect the leaves from infection or reduce the disease severity1 2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease situation, but generally, the fungicides should be sprayed before or at the onset of the disease, and repeated at regular intervals during the rainy season1 2 3. The control effect of fungicides can vary depending on the environmental conditions, the resistance of the fungus, and the coverage of the spray1 2 3.
Infected leaves and twigs should be removed and destroyed to reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease1 2 3. Pruning tools should be disinfected with alcohol or bleach after each use to avoid transmitting the fungus to healthy plants1 2. The mulberry plants should be spaced adequately to allow good air circulation and reduce leaf wetness1 2.
Some antagonistic microorganisms, such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Streptomyces spp., have been reported to inhibit the growth and sporulation of Colletotrichum spp. on mulberry leaves4 5. These biocontrol agents can be applied as foliar sprays or soil drenches to enhance the plant's resistance and suppress the pathogen's activity4 5.
Some resistant or tolerant varieties of mulberry, such as S-36, S-54, S-13, S-34, and MR-2, have been identified and recommended for cultivation in areas where anthracnose is prevalent1 2. The use of healthy planting materials and certified seeds can also prevent the introduction of the disease1 2. Crop rotation and intercropping with non-host plants can also reduce the disease incidence and severity1 2.
["Small, circular, brown or black spots on the leaves, which may coalesce into large necrotic patches1 2 3.", "Premature defoliation of infected leaves, resulting in reduced leaf yield and quality1 2 3.", "Dieback of young shoots and twigs, causing stunted growth and poor branching1 2 3."]
["Pinkish or orange masses of conidia on the surface of infected leaves and twigs, especially under humid conditions1 2 3.", "Black acervuli (fruiting bodies) embedded in the necrotic tissues, which can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope1 2 3."]
the phytopathogenic fungus of Mulberry anthracnose is Colletotrichum acutatum1 or Colletotrichum dematium2. 
one possible way to identify the disease is by observing the symptoms on the leaves, such as small, reddish-purple spots or lesions on the leaf veins, yellowing, withering, and falling off3. 
Colletotrichum dematium can colonize Mulberry leaves by producing appressoria, which are specialized structures that penetrate the plant cuticle and cell wall. The fungus can also secrete cellulases and pectinases, which are enzymes that degrade plant cell wall components and facilitate infection. The fungus can also produce melanin, which is a pigment that protects the fungus from UV radiation and oxidative stress.
