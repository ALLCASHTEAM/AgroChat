Mulberry (Morus alba L.) is a horticultural crop that is cultivated for its leaves, which are used as food for silkworms, and its fruits, which are edible for humans and animals1. Mulberry brown spot disease is a fungal disease caused by different species of Colletotrichum, such as C. dematium, C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, C. karstii, C. siamense, and C. fructicola2 3.
The pathogenic fungi of mulberry brown spot disease reproduce by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of mulberry brown spot disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and leaf wetness4. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions, and the conidia can infect the leaves through natural openings or wounds3. The disease can also spread through infected plant debris or pruning tools1.
The period of disease onset for mulberry brown spot disease varies depending on the climatic conditions and the susceptibility of the cultivars2. The disease can occur from early summer to autumn, but it is more prevalent in late summer and early autumn when the temperature and humidity are high1 5. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25 to 30В°C), high humidity (above 80%), and frequent rainfall or irrigation2 1. The disease is less severe in dry and cool climates1.
The overwintering method of mulberry brown spot disease is not well documented, but it is likely that the pathogenic fungi can survive on infected plant debris or in the soil2 3. The conidia can also remain viable on the leaf surface for several months3.
Fungicides such as carbendazim, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, and copper oxychloride can be applied as foliar sprays at recommended doses and intervals to reduce the disease severity1 2 3. The number of applications and the control effect may vary depending on the climatic conditions and the disease incidence1.
Pruning and removing the infected leaves and twigs can help reduce the inoculum source and prevent the spread of the disease1 2. The infected plant debris should be burned or buried1.
Some antagonistic microorganisms such as Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas fluorescens can be used as biocontrol agents against the pathogenic fungi1 3. These agents can be applied as soil drenches or foliar sprays to enhance the plant resistance and suppress the disease1.
Adopting good cultural practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, mulching, irrigation management, and balanced fertilization can help improve the plant health and reduce the disease susceptibility1 3. Selecting resistant or tolerant cultivars can also be an effective way to prevent the disease1.
["Small, circular, brown spots on the leaves, which may coalesce to form large necrotic areas4 5.", "Premature defoliation of the infected leaves, resulting in reduced photosynthesis and growth4 5.", "Reduced quality and quantity of mulberry leaves and fruits4 5."]
["Black, dot-like structures on the leaf spots, which are the conidia or acervuli of the pathogenic fungi4 5.", "White to pinkish masses of conidia on the leaf surface under humid conditions4 5."]
The production of efflux pumps that can expel fungicides from the fungal cells1. The alteration of cell wall composition or membrane fluidity that can reduce the penetration or binding of fungicides1. The modification of target enzymes or pathways that can reduce the sensitivity or bypass the inhibition of fungicides1. The presence of alternative oxidase that can maintain the respiration and energy production in the presence of fungicides1. 
The type and level of resistance may depend on the fungicide used and the fungal species involved1. Some studies have reported the development of resistance to benzimidazole and strobilurin fungicides in Colletotrichum species1 2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but some possible factors are: The production of cutinases, pectinases, and cellulases that can degrade the plant cell wall and facilitate the fungal penetration3. The secretion of melanin, oxalic acid, and glutathione that can protect the fungal cells from oxidative stress and enhance their virulence3. The expression of effectors, which are small secreted proteins that can modulate the plant immune response and promote the fungal colonization3 4. Some examples of effectors are CgEP1, CgDN3, and CgDN7, which are involved in host specificity, cell death induction, and suppression of plant defense, respectively4. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungi of the disease are not well identified, but some possible candidates are: The genes involved in plant hormone signaling, such as ethylene response factor (ERF) and MYB transcription factors, which can regulate plant defense and susceptibility to fungal infection. The genes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis, such as tabersonine 16-O-methyltransferase (16OMT), which can produce secondary metabolites that have antifungal activity against Colletotrichum species. The genes involved in nitric oxide accumulation, such as nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nitrate reductase (NR), which can modulate plant immune responses and limit fungal growth.
