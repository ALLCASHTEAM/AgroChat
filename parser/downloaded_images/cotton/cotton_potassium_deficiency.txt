Cotton is a cash crop that is grown for its fiber and oil1 2. Potassium deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogen, but a physiological disorder that results from inadequate supply of potassium to the plant1 3.
Since potassium deficiency is not a disease, there is no pathogenic fungus or mode of reproduction involved. Potassium deficiency can occur due to low soil potassium levels, high crop demand, drought stress, or other factors that affect potassium uptake and translocation1 4. It is not transmitted by any vector or agent.
Potassium deficiency symptoms appear as interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, that eventually progress to a red and/or gold coloration of the leaves5. In cotton prior to bloom these symptoms will be visible on the lower leaves first because the plant is able to translocate potassium from the older leaves to the newer leaves of the plant5. Potassium deficiency can also reduce boll size, fiber quality, and yield1 3. Potassium deficiency can occur in a wide range of environmental conditions, but it is more likely to happen in sandy soils with low cation exchange capacity (CEC), acidic soils with high leaching potential, or calcareous soils with high pH and calcium carbonate content1 3. Potassium deficiency can also be aggravated by drought stress, high nitrogen or magnesium fertilization, or high salinity1 3.
Since potassium deficiency is not a disease, there is no overwintering method involved.
applying potassium fertilizers according to soil test recommendations and crop demand, especially during peak boll set and fiber elongation stages1 2. The type, dose, timing, and frequency of potassium fertilizer application may vary depending on soil type, climate, irrigation, and cultivar1 2. The control effect of potassium fertilization can be measured by plant tissue analysis, yield, and fiber quality1 2.
using soil solarization, which is a method of heating the soil by covering it with transparent plastic sheets for several weeks during the summer3. Soil solarization can control soilborne pathogens of cotton and also improve the availability of potassium to cotton roots3.
using beneficial microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) or plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) that can enhance potassium uptake and utilization by cotton plants1. These microorganisms can also improve plant tolerance to abiotic stresses and increase plant growth and yield1.
using crop rotation, cover crops, organic amendments, or reduced tillage to improve soil fertility, structure, and water retention1 2. These practices can also reduce soil erosion and leaching of potassium and other nutrients1 2.
