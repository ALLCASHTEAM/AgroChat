Cotton is a cash crop that is grown for its fiber and oil1. Cotton yellow wilt disease is caused by a fungus called Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (FOV)2 1 3. There are different races of this fungus that can infect different varieties of cotton3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that can be dispersed by wind, water, insects, or contaminated seeds1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH4. The fungus can survive in the soil for many years on infected plant debris or as dormant chlamydospores1. The fungus can infect the roots of cotton plants through wounds or natural openings and then colonize the vascular system, causing wilting and yellowing of the leaves1 5.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the race of the fungus, the variety of cotton, and the environmental conditions1. Generally, the disease can appear at any stage of plant growth, but it is more severe in young seedlings or during flowering and boll formation1 5. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperatures (above 25Г‚В°C) and high soil moisture1 5. The disease is more prevalent in alkaline soils with high levels of calcium and magnesium1.
The overwintering method of this disease is by forming chlamydospores, which are thick-walled resting spores that can survive in the soil for long periods1.
According to one source1, some fungicides such as carbendazim, thiophanate-methyl, triadimefon, and tebuconazole can be used to control cotton yellow wilt disease. The application dose, period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product label, environmental conditions, and disease severity.
One possible physical measure is to cut off and destroy the infected parts of the plant to prevent the spread of the fungus1.
One potential biological control agent is Trichoderma harzianum, a fungus that can antagonize Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (FOV), the causal agent of cotton yellow wilt disease1.
Some agricultural practices that can help reduce the risk of cotton yellow wilt disease are: crop rotation, deep plowing, planting resistant varieties, adding organic matter or green manure, and avoiding excessive irrigation and fertilization2 1.
["The main symptom of cotton yellow wilt disease is wilting of the plant, which may be followed by death within a few days2.", "Other symptoms include yellowing, blighting, and necrosis of the leaves, especially along the veins3 2 1.", "The stems and branches may develop dark brown, elongated, and slightly sunken cankers that may girdle and kill the plant above the lesions2.", "The root system of affected plants may decay and show a darkened, reddish to wine-colored stain when scraped2."]
["The main sign of cotton yellow wilt disease is the presence of FOV, the fungus that causes the disease, in the water-conducting vessels of the plant3.", "Another sign is the formation of fine, light brown strands of fungal threads (rhizomorphs) on the roots of infected plants2.", "Under moist conditions, spore mats may appear on the soil surface near diseased plants. These are 2-12 inches in diameter, first snow-white and cottony, later tan and powdery2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (FOV), depends on the race and genotype of the fungus and the cotton variety. There are eight races of FOV worldwide, and three of them (3, 7, and 8) exist in China1. Some cotton varieties have natural resistance to certain races of FOV, but this resistance can be overcome by new or more aggressive genotypes of the fungus2. The mechanism of resistance is not fully understood, but it may involve plant defense responses such as production of antimicrobial compounds, cell wall reinforcement, and hypersensitive reaction1. The level of resistance can be measured by disease index, which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of diseased plants by the average disease grade1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease, Verticillium dahliae, is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers that target a gene encoding a protein involved in microsclerotia formation3. This method can detect V. dahliae DNA from infected plant tissues or soil samples within a few hours3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the invasion of V. dahliae into the xylem vessels of cotton plants, where it produces toxins and enzymes that cause wilting, chlorosis, defoliation, and necrosis4. V. dahliae has two races: defoliating (D) and non-defoliating (ND), which differ in their virulence and host range4. The D race can infect more than 200 plant species, while the ND race is mainly restricted to cotton and a few other crops4. V. dahliae produces different types and numbers of pathogenic effectors, which are small secreted proteins that modulate host immunity and susceptibility4. For example, VdAve1 is an effector that triggers resistance in tomato plants carrying the Ve1 gene, but enhances susceptibility in cotton plants lacking Ve14. VdSge1 is another effector that suppresses plant defense responses by interfering with ethylene signaling4. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are genes that are essential for cotton growth and development or for resistance to V. dahliae. For example, knockout lethal genes are genes that cause embryonic or seedling lethality when mutated or deleted5. These genes may be involved in basic cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, or metabolism5. Knockout lethal genes can be identified by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate targeted mutations in cotton genome and screening for lethal phenotypes5.
