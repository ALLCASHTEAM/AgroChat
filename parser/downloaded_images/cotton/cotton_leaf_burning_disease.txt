Cotton is an important cash crop1 2. Cotton leaf burn disease is a physiological disease caused by water stress3.
Since cotton leaf burn disease is not caused by a pathogen, there is no mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus for this disease. Cotton leaf burn disease is not transmitted by any agent, but occurs when cotton plants are exposed to high temperatures and low humidity3.
Cotton leaf burn disease usually appears in mid-July when the environmental conditions are unfavorable for cotton growth3. The environmental conditions required for cotton leaf burn disease are high temperatures (above 35В°C) and low humidity (below 40%)3.
Cotton leaf burn disease does not overwinter, as it is not caused by a pathogen.
Reducing rank growth through plant growth regulator (PGR) and water management1.
Irrigating the crop regularly and avoiding water stress2.
Chopping and plowing crop residue to accelerate decomposition1. Cutting off the infected parts of the plant to prevent further damage3.
No fungicides are currently registered for use in cotton for this disease3.

According to one source1, Corynespora cassiicola is the phytopathogenic fungus that causes cotton leaf burn disease. It has a high genetic diversity and can produce different toxins that affect the host plant's defense system1. The fungus can also adapt to different environmental conditions and resist fungicides1. The mechanism of resistance is not fully understood, but it may involve mutations in the target site of the fungicide or efflux pumps that reduce the fungicide uptake1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is not found in the search results. However, one source2 suggests that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to detect and identify the virus that causes cotton blue disease, which is another type of cotton leaf disease. PCR is a technique that amplifies a specific DNA sequence from a sample and can be used to diagnose viral infections2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is also not found in the search results. However, one source3 describes how Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV), the virus that causes cotton blue disease, infects the plant cells. CLRDV belongs to the genus Polerovirus, which has a single-stranded RNA genome and encodes six proteins3. One of these proteins, called P0, acts as a suppressor of RNA silencing, which is a natural defense mechanism of plants against viral infections3. P0 binds to and degrades a key component of the RNA silencing pathway, called AGO1, and thus prevents the plant from recognizing and destroying the viral RNA3. Another protein, called P3, acts as a movement protein, which helps the virus spread from cell to cell and from leaf to leaf3. The other four proteins are involved in viral replication and assembly3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are also not found in the search results. However, one source suggests that RNA interference (RNAi) can be used to engineer disease resistance in cotton plants against CLRDV. RNAi is a technique that uses short RNA molecules to silence the expression of specific genes. By targeting the viral genes or the host genes that are essential for viral infection, RNAi can reduce or prevent viral accumulation and symptoms in cotton plants. For example, one study showed that targeting the viral gene P0 or the host gene AGO1 with RNAi resulted in reduced viral load and delayed symptom development in cotton plants infected with CLRDV.
