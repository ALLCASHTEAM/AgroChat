Cotton is a cash crop that is grown for its fiber and oilseed1. Herbicide damage is not a disease, but a physiological disorder caused by exposure to certain chemicals that interfere with plant growth and development2.
Not applicable, since herbicide damage is not caused by a pathogenic fungus or any other microorganism. Herbicide damage can occur through different modes of transmission, such as drift, volatilization, tank contamination, sprayer malfunction, or soil carryover3 4. Drift and volatilization refer to the movement of herbicide particles or vapors from the target site to non-target plants. Tank contamination occurs when herbicide residues are left in the spray equipment and mixed with other chemicals. Sprayer malfunction can result in uneven or excessive application of herbicides. Soil carryover refers to the persistence of herbicides in the soil and their uptake by subsequent crops.
The period of disease onset for herbicide damage depends on the type and rate of herbicide, the growth stage and condition of the cotton plant, and the environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall2 4. Generally, symptoms of herbicide injury appear within a few days to a few weeks after exposure2. The environmental conditions required for herbicide damage vary depending on the specific herbicide and its mode of action. Some herbicides are more active under high temperatures and low humidity, while others are more active under cool and moist conditions2. Some herbicides are more prone to volatilization under high temperatures and low soil moisture, while others are more prone to leaching under high rainfall and low soil organic matter2. Some herbicides are more selective for certain crops or weeds, while others are more broad-spectrum and affect a wide range of plants2.

There are no specific antidotes or remedies for herbicide injury in cotton. However, some products may help reduce stress and enhance recovery of the crop, such as plant growth regulators, micronutrients, fungicides, and insecticides1. The type, dose, period, and number of applications of these products may vary depending on the situation and the label recommendations. The control effect may also vary depending on the extent of the damage and the environmental conditions.
In some cases, removing the injured plant parts may help the crop recover faster and prevent further spread of the herbicide1. This may be done by hand or by mechanical means, such as mowing or pruning.
There are no known biological agents that can mitigate herbicide injury in cotton.
The best way to prevent herbicide injury is to avoid off-target movement and drift of herbicides by following the label instructions and precautions carefully. This includes using proper equipment, nozzles, pressure, boom height, wind speed and direction, buffer zones, and spray additives1 2. Crop rotation, cover crops, and tillage may also help reduce herbicide residues in the soil and prevent carryover injury1.
["Photosynthesis inhibitors: These herbicides block the electron flow that results after the leaf absorbs light energy, causing cell membranes to rupture and plant tissues to die. Symptoms include chlorosis (yellowing) of the leaves between leaf veins or at the margins, followed by necrosis (tissue death) or its paper bag-like appearance. Older leaves are more affected than newer leaves1.", "Amino acid synthesis inhibitors (ALS inhibitors): These herbicides block the formation of essential amino acids in the plant, leading to protein deficiency and plant death. Symptoms include stunting, chlorosis, reddening or purpling of stems and leaf veins, leaf crinkling or cupping, and necrosis1.", "Growth regulators (auxin mimics): These herbicides mimic plant hormones that regulate growth and development, causing abnormal cell division and elongation. Symptoms include twisting and curling (epinasty) of stems and petioles, leaf shape distortion (strapping), leaf vein abnormality, stem cracking or splitting, malformed bolls or flowers, and reduced fruit set1 2."]
["The pattern of injury within the field or across fields. Herbicide injury may show a gradient or drift pattern that corresponds to the direction of spray or wind movement1 2.", "The presence or absence of injury on other crops or plants in the vicinity. Herbicide injury may affect only certain species or varieties that are sensitive to the herbicide, while others may be tolerant or resistant1 2.", "The history of herbicide use in the field or nearby fields. Herbicide injury may result from residues that persist in the soil or equipment from previous applications1 2."]

(1) osmotic phytotoxicity. The soil is too wet during application or rainfall occurs shortly after application, which causes phytotoxicity through root absorption. This is because in May or June to July, that is, weeding before transplanting and weeding between rows. At this time, when there is a lot of rain, or when it rains after medicine, glyphosate liquid will be leached to the rhizosphere of the soil, and phytotoxicity will be formed through the absorption and transportation of roots. This type of phytotoxicity is relatively evenly distributed in the field and is more harmful. The rate of damaged plants is generally 30% ~ 50%, even as high as over 90%. (2) drift type drug damage. Generally, there are two situations: a: glyphosate is not used in cotton fields in some places, but in the vicinity of cotton fields, aircraft spraying drugs to control reed weeds, or motorized sprayer spraying glyphosate to control other field weeds, which often causes drift and phytotoxicity to the surrounding cotton fields; B: In the process of weeding in cotton fields, due to improper operation or excessive wind speed, although directional spraying was adopted, but it is still difficult to control and make glyphosate liquid drift to cotton leaves and young stems, through the leaf, young stem absorption and produce phytotoxicity. In the field, it is not uniform, linear and banded, which is easily distinguished from healthy plants. (3) residual drug damage. In some places, due to the long-term use of glyphosate for weeding in cotton fields, sodium-salt glyphosate is easy to settle and accumulate in the soil, which causes soil salinization, and it is easy to cause toxicity to cotton plants. This kind of phytotoxicity occurs early, and some occur on the seedling bed. The cotton seedlings have obvious symptoms shortly after being transplanted to the field. They can appear on the same plot for many years and can be transmitted to the entire cotton plant, thereby inhibiting growth, severe can cause cotton growth point necrosis. This kind of harm is highly concealed and is difficult to reverse once it occurs. In some cotton areas, glyphosate is used as an insecticide by mistake due to a very small number of farmers, or the sprayer is not thoroughly cleaned after glyphosate is used, and glyphosate residue damage occurs from time to time.
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not applicable, as there is no bacteria involved in this disorder.
