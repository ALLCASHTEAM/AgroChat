Cotton is a cash crop that is grown for its fiber and oil1 2. Cotton angular spot disease is a bacterial disease caused by <em>Xanthomonas campestris</em> pv. malvacearum (also known as <em>Xanthomonas citri</em> pv malvacearum) 3 1 2.
The pathogenic bacterium of this disease does not have a sexual mode of reproduction, but reproduces by binary fission and forms conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by rain, wind, insects, or mechanical means4 5. The disease has an epidemic pattern and is transmitted by airborne, insect-borne, or mechanical means. The bacterium can enter the plant through natural openings (such as stomata or hydathodes) or wounds (such as those caused by hail, insects, or cultivation) 1 2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the cotton variety. The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but is more common and severe during the early to mid-season 1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature, high humidity, and frequent rainfall. The optimal temperature range for bacterial growth and infection is 28В°C to 32В°C, and the optimal relative humidity is above 90% 1 2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected seed, crop debris, or alternate hosts (such as okra, hibiscus, or mallow) 1 2.
There is no effective chemical control for this disease, as most bactericides are not registered for use on cotton or have limited efficacy 1 2. However, some studies have suggested that streptomycin sulphate or copper-based products may reduce the bacterial population and disease severity 3 4. The application dose, period, and number of applications may vary depending on the product label and environmental conditions.
These include cutting off or burning the infected plant parts, such as leaves, stems, or bolls, to prevent further spread of the disease 3 1. However, this may not be feasible or economical in large-scale production.
This involves using natural enemies or antagonists of the pathogen, such as other bacteria or fungi, to suppress its growth and infection. Some studies have reported that silicon (Si) can enhance the plant's resistance to the disease by inducing physical and biochemical changes in the plant tissues 4. Other studies have suggested that rhizobacteria (bacteria that live in the root zone of plants) can inhibit the pathogen by producing antibiotics or competing for nutrients.
These include cultural practices that reduce the favorable conditions for the disease development and transmission, such as crop rotation, seed treatment, resistant varieties, sanitation, irrigation management, and weed control 3 1 2.
["On leaves: The disease starts as small, water-soaked lesions (spots) that progress into characteristic angular shapes when the leaf veins restrict the bacterial movement. The lesions appear on the upper side of the leaf, turn black as they expand, and may be surrounded by a yellow ring or halo. The lesions may coalesce and cause defoliation1 5.", "On stems: The disease causes black streaks or cankers along the main veins or petioles of infected leaves. The cankers may girdle the stem and cause wilting or death of the plant. The cankers may also crack and ooze bacterial exudate 1 5.", "On bolls: The disease causes sunken, water-soaked lesions on the boll surface that may turn black or brown. The lesions may penetrate into the boll interior and cause rotting of the lint and seeds. The infected bolls may drop prematurely or remain attached to the plant 1 5."]
["On leaves: The pathogen may produce a slimy or sticky substance called bacterial exudate on the surface of infected lesions. The exudate may dry up and form a white crust or film that can be scraped off with a knife or fingernail 1 5.", "On stems: The pathogen may also produce bacterial exudate on the stem cankers that may ooze out when squeezed or cut open 1 5.", "On bolls: The pathogen may cause a foul-smelling liquid to leak out of infected bolls when pressed or split open 1 5."]
The mechanism of resistance of the bacterium, such as producing enzymes that degrade plant cell walls, secreting toxins that damage plant tissues, or suppressing plant immune responses. The type of resistance agent of the bacterium, such as plasmids, transposons, or effector proteins that carry genes or functions that confer resistance to the bacterium. The level of resistance of the bacterium, which may vary depending on the environmental conditions, the host plant genotype, and the pathogen race. The level of resistance may be measured by the disease severity, incidence, or area under disease progress curve (AUDPC). 
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): This is a molecular technique that amplifies specific DNA sequences of the bacterium using primers and enzymes. The amplified DNA can be detected by gel electrophoresis or fluorescence. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP): This is a molecular technique that amplifies specific DNA sequences of the bacterium using primers and enzymes under isothermal conditions. The amplified DNA can be detected by color change or fluorescence. Immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM): This is a serological technique that uses antibodies labeled with fluorescent dyes to bind to specific antigens of the bacterium on plant tissues. The bound antibodies can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy. 
The bacterium enters the plant through natural openings (such as stomata or hydathodes) or wounds (such as those caused by hail, insects, or cultivation) 1 2. The bacterium attaches to the plant cell surface by using adhesins, pili, or flagella. The bacterium injects effector proteins into the plant cell cytoplasm by using a type III secretion system (T3SS). The effector proteins may modulate plant immune responses, alter plant gene expression, or interfere with plant signaling pathways. The bacterium degrades plant cell walls by producing cellulases, pectinases, or xylanases. The degraded cell walls release nutrients for bacterial growth and cause water-soaking or necrosis of plant tissues 1 2. The bacterium produces toxins that damage plant cells or tissues, such as tabtoxin, phaseolotoxin, coronatine, or syringomycin. The toxins may cause chlorosis, wilting, or browning of plant tissues 1
