Cotton is a cash crop that is grown for its fiber and oilseed1. Cotton Blight is a bacterial disease caused by <em>Xanthomonas citri </em>pv. <em>malvacearum</em> (Xcm), a Gram-negative, a motile rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium with a single polar flagellum1 2.
The pathogenic bacterium of Cotton Blight reproduces by binary fission and forms conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by rain, wind, insects or contaminated tools2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of Cotton Blight are influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and rainfall. The disease thrives in extremely warm (86 to 95 В°F), humid environments with frequent rainstorms4 3. The bacterium enters the plant through open stomata or wounds caused by blowing dust, sand or insects2. The disease can spread systemically within the plant and affect stems, leaves, bracts, and bolls1.
The period of disease onset for Cotton Blight varies depending on the stage of plant growth and the environmental conditions. The disease can be observed on seedlings as well as mature plants1. The symptoms usually appear 7 to 10 days after infection3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (86 to 95 Г‚В°F), high humidity (\&gt;90%) and frequent rainfall (\&gt;0.5 inch per week)3. The disease is more severe in dense, rank growth that reduces air circulation within the canopy2. The disease is also favored by alkaline soil conditions (pH \&gt;7.5)3.
The overwintering method of Cotton Blight is mainly through infested crop debris or seeds3. The bacterium can survive on plant residues for several months2. Some weed species may also serve as asymptomatic hosts for the bacterium and provide inoculum for the next season2.
Seed treatment with authorized antibiotics and seed dressing with copper oxychloride are very effective against the bacteria causing Cotton Blight1. However, there are no fungicides recommended or labeled for bacterial blight control on cotton plants2 3.
Cutting off and destroying the infected parts of the plant can reduce the spread of the disease1. Acid delinting of cotton seeds can also eliminate the seed-borne inoculum of the bacterium2 3.
There is no known biological control agent for Cotton Blight2.
Planting resistant cotton varieties is the most effective and economical way to manage Cotton Blight2 3 4 5. However, resistance may be overcome by new races of the bacterium2 4. Crop rotation with non-host crops can reduce the inoculum load in the soil1. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization and applying growth regulators can prevent rank growth and improve air circulation within the canopy2. Avoiding mechanical injury or insect damage to the plants can prevent entry points for the bacterium2.

["The presence of Xcm bacteria on the infected plant tissues, which can be detected by laboratory methods such as isolation, microscopy, serology, PCR or DNA sequencing4 5.", "The exudation of bacterial ooze from the lesions, which may form a whitish film on the leaf surface when dry1."]
Mechanism of resistance: The bacterium can overcome the resistance of some cotton varieties by producing different races that have different combinations of pathogenic effectors1 2. These effectors are proteins that are secreted by the bacterium and interact with the plant's immune system2. Some effectors can trigger a hypersensitive response (HR) in resistant plants, leading to cell death and limiting bacterial growth2. Other effectors can suppress the HR or other defense responses in susceptible plants, allowing the bacterium to colonize and cause disease2. Type of resistance agent: The resistance of cotton to Cotton Blight is mainly conferred by major resistance genes (B genes) that recognize specific effectors of the bacterium1 2. There are more than 20 B genes identified, each with different specificities and effects1. Some B genes may also interact with each other or with other minor genes to enhance or modify resistance1. Level of resistance: The level of resistance of cotton to Cotton Blight depends on the interaction between the B genes and the effectors of the bacterium1 2. Some B genes may confer complete resistance (immunity) to certain races of the bacterium, while others may confer partial resistance (tolerance) or susceptibility1. The level of resistance may also vary depending on environmental conditions, plant growth stage and inoculum pressure1. 
Leaf infiltration assay: This method involves injecting a bacterial suspension into the intercellular spaces of a cotton leaf using a syringe or a needleless injector2. The leaf is then observed for symptoms such as water-soaking, necrosis or wilting after 24 to 48 hours2. This method can be used to test the virulence of different bacterial strains or isolates, or the resistance of different cotton varieties or lines2. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The bacterium produces at least 21 pathogenic effectors that belong to different families such as transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors<em>, Xanthomonas</em> outer protein (Xop) effectors and hypothetical proteins2. These effectors have diverse functions and targets in the plant cell, such as modulating gene expression, manipulating hormone signaling, interfering with cell wall integrity, suppressing reactive oxygen species production and altering plant metabolism2. Differences in infestation of different plants: The bacterium can infect different plants within the <em>Malvaceae</em> family, such as cotton, okra, hibiscus and mallow3. However, the degree and type of infection may vary depending on the host species and genotype, as well as the bacterial race and strain3 2. For example, some cotton varieties may be resistant to some races of the bacterium but susceptible to others, while some okra varieties may be susceptible to all races of the bacterium3 2. 
Knockout lethal genes: These are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of the bacterium, and whose disruption or deletion would result in bacterial death or attenuation. Knockout lethal genes can be identified by using transposon mutagenesis, genome sequencing or gene expression analysis. Some examples of knockout lethal genes in Xcm are dnaA (involved in DNA replication), gyrB (involved in DNA supercoiling), rpoD (involved in RNA polymerase activity) and secA (involved in protein secretion).
