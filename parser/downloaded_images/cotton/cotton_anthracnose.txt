Cotton is a cash crop that is grown for its fiber and oilseed1 2. Cotton anthracnose is a fungal disease caused by an ascomycete (Glomerella gossypii) that produces reddish brown to light-colored or necrotic spots on seedling parts and on leaves, stems, and bolls3 4.
The pathogenic fungus of cotton anthracnose reproduces by conidia that are produced in tiny, sunken, saucer-shaped fruiting bodies known as acervuli1 5. The disease is airborne and the conidia are dispersed by wind, rain, insects, or mechanical means2 5. The disease can also be transmitted by infected seeds2.
The period of disease onset for cotton anthracnose varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the cultivar. The disease can occur in all growth stages of the plant, but it is more severe during flowering and boll development2 4. The disease can also affect seedlings and cause damping-off or seedling blight2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid weather, with temperatures ranging from 20 to 30Г‚В°C and relative humidity above 85%2 4. The disease also favors acidic soils with low organic matter and poor drainage2.
The overwintering method of cotton anthracnose is by surviving on infected plant debris or seeds2 5. The fungus can also persist in the soil for several years2.
Fungicides such as benomyl, thiophanate-methyl, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, or copper compounds can be applied to protect the plants from infection or reduce the spread of the disease1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the fungus1.
Infected plant parts such as leaves, stems, or bolls should be removed or buried to reduce the inoculum source3 1. Infected seeds should be discarded or treated with hot water or fungicides before planting1 2.
Some antagonistic microorganisms such as Trichoderma spp., Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., or Streptomyces spp. have been reported to inhibit the growth or infection of Colletotrichum gossypii in vitro or in vivo1. However, their efficacy and availability may be limited by various factors1.
Crop rotation with non-host crops can help to reduce the soil-borne inoculum3 1. Resistant or tolerant cultivars can be planted to minimize the disease damage1 4. Pruning or spacing the plants can improve the air circulation and reduce the humidity3 1. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization can also reduce the susceptibility of the plants1.

The lesions are pinkish-brown, sometimes concentrically zoned, and may become necrotic5 1 4.", "Witches' broom disease in South America, resulting from the abnormal growth of normally quiescent axillary and terminal buds5 1.", "Boll rot characterized by small, rapidly expanding, reddish-brown spots on the capsule, which blacken and are sometimes concentrically zoned. The spots may lead to a coating of thick, grey mycelium on the surface of the affected boll, sometimes with a pink coloration due to conidial masses, followed by production of small black setose fruit bodies as the boll dries out5 1 4."]
["Conidia that are produced in tiny, sunken, saucer-shaped fruiting bodies known as acervuli. The conidia are hyaline, cylindrical to fusiform, and have one to several septa. They are usually visible as pink masses on the surface of infected tissues5 1 2.", "Setae that are produced along with conidia in acervuli. The setae are dark brown, thick-walled, and pointed at both ends. They are usually visible as black hairs on infected bolls5 1 2.", "Perithecia that are produced in pseudothecia (stromata) within infected tissues. The perithecia are globose to subglobose, dark brown to black, and have a short neck. They contain ascospores that are hyaline, fusiform to clavate, and have one to several septa. They are usually visible as small black dots on infected bolls5 1 2."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus can develop resistance to fungicides by altering the target site, increasing the efflux of the fungicide, or degrading the fungicide1 2. The fungus can also overcome the host resistance by mutating or recombining its avirulence genes or effectors3 4. Type of resistance agent: The fungus can be resistant to different classes of fungicides, such as benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, demethylation inhibitors (DMIs), quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs)1 2. The fungus can also be resistant to different sources of host resistance genes, such as C. baccatum and C. chinense3 4. Level of resistance: The level of resistance can vary depending on the fungicide concentration, the fungal isolate, and the environmental conditions1 2. The level of resistance can also vary depending on the host genotype, the fungal population, and the disease pressure3 4. 
Seed health test: A simple and rapid method to detect Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides in cotton seeds is to incubate the seeds in a moist chamber for 7 days and observe the presence or absence of pink conidial masses on the seed surface5. Molecular test: A more sensitive and specific method to identify Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides is to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers designed from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA or from other genomic regions3 4. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides produces various effectors that modulate the host defense responses and facilitate the infection process. Some of these effectors are secreted during appressorium formation and penetration, such as cutinases, pectinases, cellulases, xylanases, and lipases3. Others are secreted during biotrophic and necrotrophic phases, such as proteases, glucanases, chitinases, oxalate oxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase3. The number of effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain and the host species3 4. Differences in infestation of different plants: Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides can infect different plant species within the Malvaceae family, such as cotton, okra, hibiscus, and malva3. However, the degree of susceptibility and resistance may differ depending on the plant genotype and the fungal isolate3 4. For example, some cotton cultivars are resistant to certain strains of Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides but susceptible to others3 4. 
Knockout lethal genes: Some genes that are essential for fungal growth or pathogenicity may be potential targets for developing novel fungicides or transgenic plants. For example, genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, signal transduction, oxidative stress response, nutrient uptake, or effector secretion may be candidates for knockout lethal genes3 2.
