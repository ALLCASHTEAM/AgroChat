Cotton is a cash crop that is grown for its fiber and seed oil1 2. Magnesium deficiency is a physiological disease that affects the chlorophyll production and photosynthesis of cotton plants3 4.
Magnesium deficiency is not caused by a pathogenic fungus, so it does not have a mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus. Magnesium deficiency is not transmitted by any agent, but it occurs due to soil factors such as high leaching, high lime or potassium content, acidic or alkaline pH, or low organic matter3 5 6.
Magnesium deficiency can occur at any stage of cotton growth, but it is more common in the early or mid-season7. It can also appear in late season when the soil cannot supply enough magnesium for boll development7. Magnesium deficiency occurs more frequently in sandy soils, humic acid soils, or soils with high potassium3 1. It can also be aggravated by cold and wet conditions that reduce root activity and magnesium uptake1 6.
Magnesium deficiency does not have an overwintering method, as it is not caused by a living organism.
Applying magnesium fertilizers such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, or magnesium nitrate to the soil or foliar spray1 2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the soil test results, crop growth stage, and deficiency severity1 2 3. The control effect can be measured by monitoring the leaf color, plant growth, and yield1 2 3.

Using organic manure and compost manure to increase the soil organic matter and magnesium availability4. Avoiding excessive lime or potassium applications that can reduce magnesium uptake1 5. Including legumes in the pasture that have higher magnesium content than grass5.
["Interveinal chlorosis with sharply bordered green veins on mature leaves1 2 4. The chlorosis can progress to yellowing, reddening, or browning of the leaf margins and blade2 4.", "Stunted plant growth, reduced boll retention, delayed flowering, and premature maturity6 2 4."]

The concepts of resistance mechanisms, types of resistant agents, and levels of resistance that are not applicable to the case of magnesium deficiency in cotton.
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of magnesium deficiency in cotton is to use a leaf disc assay. This method involves inoculating leaf discs with bacterial suspensions and incubating them in a moist chamber. The bacterial growth and disease symptoms can be observed after 24 to 48 hours1. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of magnesium deficiency in cotton is not well understood. However, some studies suggest that magnesium deficiency reduces the plant's resistance to bacterial infections by affecting the cell wall structure, photosynthesis, and antioxidant system1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the bacterial strain and the plant genotype1. Magnesium deficiency may also affect the infestation of different plants differently, depending on their magnesium requirement and tolerance2. 
There are no specific genes or bacteria associated with magnesium deficiency in cotton.
