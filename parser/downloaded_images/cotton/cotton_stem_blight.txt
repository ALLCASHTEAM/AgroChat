Cotton is a cash crop that is grown for its fiber and oilseed1. Cotton stem blight is a fungal disease caused by the necrotrophic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum1 2.
The pathogenic fungus of cotton stem blight reproduces by producing sclerotia, which are hard, black, irregularly shaped structures that can survive in the soil for several years1 2. The sclerotia can germinate to produce apothecia, which are cup-shaped structures that release ascospores, which are airborne spores that can infect the plant tissues1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of cotton stem blight are influenced by cool temperature (between 59 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit) and moist conditions under a closed plant canopy3 2. The ascospores can land on the plant surface and penetrate the tissues directly or through wounds caused by insects or mechanical damage1. The fungus can also infect the lower stem and other foliage tissues near the soil surface by growing from the sclerotia1.
The period of disease onset for cotton stem blight is usually during the flowering and boll development stages of the cotton plant, when the canopy is dense and humid1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool temperature (between 59 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit) and moist conditions under a closed plant canopy1 2. The disease is more severe in fields with a history of bean production, which is a susceptible host for the fungus1.
The overwintering method of this disease is by forming sclerotia, which can survive in the soil for several years and germinate to produce apothecia and ascospores when the conditions are favorable1 2.
Fungicides such as boscalid, fluazinam, and thiophanate-methyl can be applied to protect the plants from infection by ascospores1. However, fungicides are not effective against sclerotia in the soil2.
Infected plant parts should be removed and destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease and the formation of sclerotia2. Deep plowing can bury the sclerotia and reduce their germination3.
Some antagonistic microorganisms such as Trichoderma spp. and Gliocladium spp. can inhibit the growth of S. sclerotiorum and reduce its sclerotia formation4. However, their efficacy may vary depending on environmental conditions and application methods4.
Crop rotation with non-host crops such as cereals and grasses can reduce the inoculum level in the soil2. Avoiding excessive irrigation and nitrogen fertilization can prevent the development of a dense and humid canopy that favors the disease2. Planting resistant or tolerant varieties can also reduce the disease severity5.

The fungus can produce oxalic acid, which can degrade the plant cell walls and suppress the plant defense responses1. The fungus can secrete necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptides (NEPs), which can induce cell death and ethylene production in the plant tissues1. The fungus can express avirulence (Avr) genes, which can trigger resistance in the plant if they are recognized by the corresponding resistance (R) genes2. However, the fungus can also mutate or delete its Avr genes to avoid recognition2. The fungus can have genetic diversity among different isolates, which can affect its virulence and pathogenicity on different hosts3. The fungus can be affected by environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and pH, which can influence its growth, sporulation, and infection4. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is not available, as the disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium. However, a quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which can detect the DNA of S. sclerotiorum from infected plant tissues within an hour. 
The fungus produces sclerotia in the soil or on infected plant debris, which can survive for several years under unfavorable conditions4. The sclerotia germinate to produce apothecia under moist and cool conditions, which release ascospores into the air4. The ascospores land on the plant surface and penetrate the tissues directly or through wounds caused by insects or mechanical damage4. The fungus grows inside the plant tissues and produces oxalic acid and NEPs, which cause cell death and tissue necrosis1. The fungus produces more sclerotia on or inside the infected tissues, which can fall off and contaminate the soil or be dispersed by wind or water4. 
The R genes of the plant that can recognize the Avr genes of the fungus and activate resistance responses2. For example, R gene B12 confers resistance to races 1 to 19 of S. sclerotiorum in cotton. The cell wall components of the plant that can act as barriers or signals against fungal invasion. For example, lignin, suberin, callose, and phenolic compounds can limit fungal growth and trigger defense responses. The antioxidant enzymes of the plant that can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by fungal infection. For example, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) can protect plant cells from oxidative damage.
