Cotton whorl spot disease affects cotton, which is a cash crop that is grown for its fiber and oilseed. 1 2 Cotton whorl spot disease is a fungal disease caused by Ascochyta gossypii, which can also cause boll rot and escobilla. 2
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in structures called pycnidia. The conidia are dispersed by rain splash or wind and infect the young leaves and bolls of cotton plants. 2 The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and irrigation. The disease is more severe in regions with high humidity and frequent rainfall, which favor the development and spread of the fungus. The disease can also be transmitted by contaminated seeds or plant debris. 2
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually during the early stages of cotton growth, when the plants have whorls of young leaves that are susceptible to infection. The disease can also occur later in the season, when the plants have bolls that can be infected by the fungus. 2 The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid weather, with temperatures ranging from 20Г‚В°C to 30Г‚В°C and relative humidity above 80%. The disease is also favored by excessive irrigation or rainfall, which create wet conditions on the plant surface and soil. 2
The overwintering method of this disease is by survival of the fungus on infected plant debris or seeds that remain in the soil or on the field. The fungus can also survive on alternative hosts such as weeds or other crops that are susceptible to Ascochyta gossypii. 2
Fungicides such as azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, propiconazole, and tebuconazole can be applied to protect the plants from infection or reduce the severity of the disease. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product label, environmental conditions, disease pressure, and resistance management. 1
Infected plant parts such as leaves and bolls can be removed and destroyed to prevent the spread of the fungus. The plant debris should be buried or burned to avoid leaving inoculum on the soil surface. 1
Some antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, and Pseudomonas fluorescens can be used to suppress the growth and activity of Ascochyta gossypii. These biocontrol agents can be applied as seed treatments, soil amendments, or foliar sprays.
Some cultural practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, resistant varieties, seed treatment, balanced fertilization, irrigation management, weed control, and pruning can help reduce the incidence and severity of the disease. These practices can enhance the plant health and vigor, reduce the inoculum level and source, and modify the microclimate to make it less favorable for the fungus. 1
["Cotton verticillium spot disease can infect the cotyledons and true leaves of cotton, stalks, bolls and flower buds, of which the most serious damage to the leaves, in the cotton growth cycle can occur throughout the whole cycle, mostly occurring in the cotton seedling cotyledons and adult leaves. In the young cotyledons, the typical manifestation of the disease is a small brown circular spot, the edge of the spot is purple; in the right conditions, the diameter of the spot can be extended to 10-15 mm; sometimes the petiole will also be affected, yellowish-brown stripes, and in severe cases, the cotyledons dry and fall off. The spots on the leaves in the adult stage are brown dotted spots with purple halos, about 1-2 mm in diameter, and the diameter of the spots can be up to 2-3 cm in serious cases; with the occurrence of the disease, the spots expand to gray-brown suborbicular, dry and fragile, and the necrotic spots may rupture and fall off, forming "holes"; the spots have concentric whorls on both sides, and the spots are more obvious on the front side; when conditions are favorable, the spots will appear yellow-brown stripes, and in serious cases, the cotyledons dry up and fall off. Concentric whorls on both sides of the spot, more obvious on the front side of the leaf; black mold appears on the surface of the spot when the conditions are suitable, i.e. the pathogenic bacteria."]
["The disease signs of this disease are pycnidia, which are small black structures that contain the conidia of Ascochyta gossypii. The pycnidia can be seen on the surface of the spots on the leaves and bolls with a magnifying lens or a microscope. The conidia are hyaline, unicellular, oval to cylindrical, and have a truncate base. They can be observed under a microscope after crushing the pycnidia or placing them in water. 1"]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some reports suggest that Ascochyta gossypii can develop resistance to some fungicides such as benzimidazoles and strobilurins. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the target site of the fungicide, such as the beta-tubulin gene or the cytochrome b gene, or increased expression of efflux pumps that reduce the accumulation of the fungicide in the fungal cells. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide dose, frequency, and mode of action. 1 2 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is by using a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which can detect the DNA of Ascochyta gossypii from infected plant samples within an hour. The LAMP assay is based on the amplification of a specific region of the fungal genome using four primers and a DNA polymerase under isothermal conditions. The LAMP assay can be performed in a simple water bath or a heating block, and the results can be visualized by adding a fluorescent dye or observing turbidity. The LAMP assay is sensitive, specific, rapid, and cost-effective compared to conventional PCR methods. 3 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but some studies suggest that Ascochyta gossypii can produce several pathogenic effectors that modulate the plant defense responses and facilitate infection. Some of these effectors include necrosis-inducing proteins, cutinases, cellulases, pectinases, and lipases, which can degrade the plant cell wall and membrane components and cause cell death. Other effectors include small secreted proteins (SSPs), which can suppress the plant immune system and manipulate the plant hormone signaling pathways. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may differ depending on the fungal strain and the host plant species. 4 5 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are not well known, but some studies have identified some genes that are involved in the plant resistance or susceptibility to Ascochyta gossypii infection. For example, one study found that a gene encoding a receptor-like kinase (RLK) was associated with increased resistance to cotton whorl spot disease in cotton cultivars. The RLK gene may function as a sensor of fungal signals and activate the plant defense responses. Another study found that a gene encoding a transcription factor (TF) was associated with increased susceptibility to cotton whorl spot disease in cotton cultivars. The TF gene may regulate the expression of genes involved in plant growth and development, which may affect the plant tolerance to fungal stress.
