Radish is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Brassicaceae1. Radish white spot disease is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Albugo candida2 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or water3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop density. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions, and in dense plantings. The fungus can infect the leaves, stems, flowers, and pods of radishes, and can also survive on other cruciferous crops or weeds4.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the radish cultivar. The disease can appear at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during the flowering and podding stages3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid climates, with temperatures ranging from 15 to 25В°C and relative humidity above 80%. The fungus also prefers moist soil conditions and poor drainage3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by forming oospores, which are thick-walled sexual spores that can survive in the soil or on plant debris for several years3.
The application of fungicides such as Bordeaux liquid, copper sulfate, or copper fungicides can help reduce the severity and spread of the disease1 2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the environmental conditions. The control effect may vary depending on the stage of infection and the resistance of the radish cultivar.
The removal and destruction of infected plants or plant parts can help prevent the disease from spreading to healthy plants4 1. The infected plant debris should be burned or buried deep in the soil to avoid spore dispersal.
There is no known biological agent that can effectively control this disease. However, some beneficial microorganisms such as Trichoderma or Bacillus may have some antagonistic effects on the fungus3.
The use of healthy and certified seeds or transplants can help avoid introducing the disease into the field1. The practice of crop rotation with non-host crops such as cereals, legumes, or grasses can help reduce the inoculum level in the soil5. The improvement of soil drainage and aeration can help prevent waterlogging and reduce fungal growth1. The reduction of crop density and the removal of weeds can help improve air circulation and reduce humidity1 5. The avoidance of overhead irrigation and the use of drip irrigation can help reduce leaf wetness and spore dispersal1.
["White, raised spore masses on the underside of the leaves, which may be barely visible to a ВЅ inch (1 cm) across or larger4 5.", "Yellowing, wilting, curling, or distortion of the leaves, which may eventually fall off prematurely1 5.", "Reduced plant growth, vigor, yield, and quality1 5.", "Infection of other plant parts such as stems, flowers, and pods, which may show white spots or lesions1 5."]
["The presence of conidia, which are asexual spores that are oval-shaped, hyaline, and single-celled. They are produced in chains on conidiophores that emerge from the spore masses5.", "The presence of oospores, which are sexual spores that are spherical, thick-walled, and dark-colored. They are formed by the fusion of male and female gametes inside the plant tissue5."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some reports suggest that the fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides such as benomyl and metalaxyl1. The mechanism of resistance may involve the alteration of the target site or the enhancement of the detoxification system1. The level of resistance may depend on the frequency and dose of fungicide application, as well as the genetic diversity of the fungal population1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a lactophenol cotton blue stain to observe the spores and hyphae of the fungus under a microscope2. The spores are oval-shaped, hyaline, and single-celled, and are produced in chains on conidiophores that emerge from the spore masses2. The hyphae are septate and coenocytic, and may form oospores inside the plant tissue2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but some studies suggest that the fungus can produce several pathogenic effectors that can manipulate the host defense response and facilitate infection3. Some of these effectors include necrosis-inducing proteins, protease inhibitors, cell wall-degrading enzymes, and small secreted proteins3. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the compatibility between the fungal effectors and the host receptors, as well as the host resistance genes3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are not clearly identified, but some studies suggest that some genes involved in plant immunity, cell wall biosynthesis, signal transduction, and metabolism may be important for host susceptibility or resistance to the fungus4. For example, some knockout mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana that are defective in salicylic acid signaling, ethylene signaling, or flavonoid biosynthesis showed increased susceptibility to Albugo candida infection4.
