Radish is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is grown for its slightly spicy, crunchy taproot1. Radish crinkle virus disease is a viral disease caused by Radish crinkle virus (RCV), which belongs to the genus Carmovirus and the family Tombusviridae2.
The pathogenic fungus of this disease is not applicable, since it is a viral disease and not a fungal disease. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are airborne and insectborne. RCV can be transmitted by mechanical inoculation, by seed, and by aphids in a non-persistent manner2.
The period of disease onset for this disease is within 7 days after inoculation with RCV2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature and low humidity. RCV infection is more severe at 25В°C than at 15В°C or 35В°C, and more severe at 40% relative humidity than at 80% relative humidity2.
The overwintering method of this disease is seed transmission. RCV can be transmitted through radish seeds at a rate of 0.1-0.5%2.
Use certified virus-free seeds or treat seeds with hot water (50В°C for 25 minutes) to eliminate seed-borne infection1.
Avoid planting radish near other crops that are hosts of RCV, such as cucurbits, brassicas, and weeds1.
Remove and destroy infected plants and crop residues to reduce sources of inoculum2 1.
Control aphid vectors by using yellow sticky traps, reflective mulches, intercropping with repellent plants, or applying insecticides2 1.
["This disease is interveinal chlorosis, yellowing, and drying of lower leaves on radish plants1.", "The symptoms are more severe at high temperature and low humidity conditions1."]
["This disease is the presence of virus particles in the infected plant tissues, which can be detected by electron microscopy, serological tests, or molecular techniques1.", "The virus particles are rod-shaped and about 30 nm in diameter and 300 nm in length1."]
