Radish is a horticultural crop that belongs to the crucifer family1 2. Black rot of radish is a bacterial disease caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris2.
The bacterium does not have a fungal mode of reproduction, but it can form biofilms on plant surfaces and survive in soil and plant debris2. The bacterium can enter the plant through hydathodes, which are natural openings at leaf margins, or through wounds, such as those made by insects2. The disease can spread by wind, water splash, insects and animals2.
The disease can occur at any point in plant development, but symptoms are more likely to appear during warm and humid weather conditions2. The disease prefers cool, wet soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.51 3.
The bacterium can overwinter in infested seed, infected transplants, and infected cruciferous weeds2.
There are currently no registered fungicides for treatment of this disease1.
Infected plants and plant debris should be removed and destroyed, along with plants in a 3- to 5-foot radius around the affected plant2 3. Soil can be solarized to reduce the pathogen population1.
No effective biological agents have been reported for this disease.
Crop rotation every 3 years with non-crucifer crops can help prevent the disease1 4. Seeds should be sterilized before sowing4. Plants should be grown in well-drained soil and avoid overwatering3. Resistant varieties should be used, such as French Breakfast, White Spike, Red Prince, Belle Glade, and Fuego1.
["Seedlings may die prematurely or become yellow and drop lower leaves1.", "Older plants may develop yellowing at leaf margins in a wedge or V-shape, followed by browning and necrosis1 3. Affected leaves may drop off1.", "Roots may develop dark spots, cracks, and lesions that turn black and dry2 1. Root growth may be distorted or constricted3.", "Cauliflower curds may become infected and turn brown1."]
["The veins in infected leaves, stems, and roots may become black because of the bacterial secretion of an extracellular polysaccharide that plugs normal water flow1. This can be seen by cutting crosswise the stems and leaf petioles1.", "The bacterium can be isolated from infected plant tissue and cultured on a selective medium1."]
Mechanism of resistance: The bacterium can produce an extracellular polysaccharide that protects it from environmental stress and host defense1. It can also secrete enzymes that degrade plant cell walls and induce plant cell death1. Type of resistance agent: The bacterium can be resistant to some copper-based fungicides, which are commonly used to control bacterial diseases1. Level of resistance: The level of resistance may vary depending on the strain of the bacterium and the environmental conditions1. 
Isolation and culture: The bacterium can be isolated from infected plant tissue and cultured on a selective medium, such as yeast peptone glucose agar with cycloheximide and cephalexin1. The colonies are yellow, mucoid, and circular1. Biochemical and molecular tests: The bacterium can be identified by its biochemical characteristics, such as oxidase negative, catalase positive, nitrate reduction positive, starch hydrolysis positive, and gelatin liquefaction positive1. It can also be detected by molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers1. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The bacterium can produce several pathogenic effectors that modulate plant immunity and facilitate infection1. These include type III secretion system (T3SS), which delivers effector proteins into plant cells; type IV pilus (T4P), which mediates attachment and motility; xanthan gum, which forms a protective capsule; xanthomonadin, which acts as a pigment and antioxidant; and extracellular enzymes, such as cellulases, pectinases, proteases, and lipases, which degrade plant cell walls and membranes1. Differences in infestation of different plants: The bacterium can infect most cruciferous plants, but some plants are more susceptible than others. For example, cauliflower and cabbage are the most readily affected hosts, while radish is quite resistant, but not to all strains2. The susceptibility may depend on the plant genotype, the bacterial strain, and the environmental factors1. 
The bacteria that causes black rot disease in radish is <em>Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris</em> (Xcc). It is a vascular disease that infects cruciferous plants through hydathodes or wounds, migrates to the xylem vessels where it multiplies, and develops V-shaped necrotic lesions with yellowing areas on leaves3.
