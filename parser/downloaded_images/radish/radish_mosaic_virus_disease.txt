Radish is a horticultural crop that belongs to the cruciferous family1. Radish mosaic virus disease is a viral disease caused by a plant pathogenic virus of the family Comoviridae2.
The pathogenic virus of this disease does not have a fungus, so it does not have a mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus. The mode of transmission of this disease is mainly by aphids that feed on infected plants and transfer the virus to healthy plants3. The virus can also be transmitted by mechanical inoculation or by seed1.
The period of disease onset for this disease depends on the environmental conditions and the host plant, but it can range from a few days to several weeks after infection1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are not well known, but it is likely that warm and humid conditions favor the development and spread of the virus1.
The overwintering method of this disease is not well documented, but it is possible that the virus can survive in perennial weeds or in seeds3.
There is no specific chemical agent that can cure the infected plants, but some insecticides can be used to reduce the population of aphids and other vectors that transmit the virus1 2. However, insecticides may also have negative effects on the environment and human health, so they should be used with caution and according to the label instructions3.
Infected plants should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent the spread of the virus to other plants1 2. Do not put them in the compost pile, as the virus may persist in infected plant matter1. Disinfect gardening tools after every use to avoid mechanical transmission of the virus2.
Some microbial biostimulants, such as Trichoderma harzianum and Bacillus subtilis, have been shown to enhance plant growth and resistance against mosaic viruses by modulating plant immune responses and inducing systemic acquired resistance3. These biostimulants can be applied as seed treatments or foliar sprays3.
Use virus-free seeds or transplants from certified sources2. Avoid planting radish near other cruciferous crops or weeds that may harbor the virus2. Practice crop rotation and intercropping with non-host plants to reduce the risk of infection2. Grow resistant or tolerant varieties of radish if available2.
["Mosaic: The leaves show yellow, white, or light and dark green spots and streaks that give them a mosaic-like appearance1 2.", "Ringspots: The leaves may also develop circular or irregular spots with chlorotic or necrotic centers and green margins4.", "Leaf distortion: The leaves may become wrinkled, curled, or small due to the virus infection1 2.", "Veinal necrosis: The veins of the leaves may turn brown or black and die due to the virus infection4.", "Systemic necrosis: The whole plant may wilt and die due to severe virus infection4."]
["This disease are not very obvious, as the virus itself is microscopic and cannot be seen by naked eye.", "However, some methods can be used to detect the presence of the virus in the plant tissue, such as serological tests (e.g., ELISA), molecular tests (e.g., PCR), or electron microscopy4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, as the virus itself does not have a fungus. However, some studies have reported that a phytopathogenic fungus, Rhizoctonia solani, can host a plant virus, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and that this cross-kingdom viral infection may affect the pathogenicity and virulence of the fungus1. The mechanism of resistance, the type of resistance agent, and the level of resistance of the fungus to the virus are unknown. 
There is no quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease, as the virus itself does not have a bacteria. The virus can be detected by serological tests (e.g., ELISA), molecular tests (e.g., PCR), or electron microscopy2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not well understood, but it is likely that the virus enters the plant cells through wounds or natural openings and replicates in the cytoplasm2. The virus may produce some pathogenic effectors that interfere with the plant defense responses and cause symptoms such as mosaic, ringspots, leaf distortion, veinal necrosis, and systemic necrosis2. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host range and specificity of the virus, as well as the genetic and environmental factors of the plants2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well identified, as the virus itself does not have a bacteria. However, some studies have suggested that some genes or proteins involved in plant immunity or metabolism may be involved in the resistance or susceptibility to mosaic viruses3. For example, a gene encoding a receptor-like kinase (RLK) was found to confer resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in tobacco plants3.
