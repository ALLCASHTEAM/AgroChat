Radish is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible underground root1. Yellow spot leaf blight of radish is a fungal disease caused by <em>Cercospora brassicae</em>2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of this disease reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind, water or cultivation2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by temperature, humidity, plant density, crop rotation, and sanitation. The disease is more severe in cool and moist conditions, and when plants are crowded or planted in the same area repeatedly. The fungus can survive in soil or plant debris, and infect new plants through splashed or windblown spores2 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental factors, but it usually occurs in the early to mid-season of radish growth. The first symptoms are small, circular, gray to brown spots with dark margins on the leaves. As the disease progresses, the spots enlarge and coalesce, causing the leaves to turn yellow and wilt. The petioles and stems may also develop long lesions of greenish gray. The infected leaves may fall off, exposing the roots to sunscald2 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool temperatures (55 to 65 degrees F or 13 to 18 В° C), high humidity, poor drainage, and low soil pH. These conditions favor the germination and infection of the spores and the development and spread of the disease2 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is through soil-borne inoculum or infected plant debris. The fungus can survive for several years in soil or organic matter, and can also be carried by volunteer plants, weeds, or wild crucifers. The spores can be activated by rain or irrigation in the spring, and infect new plants2 4.
Applying fungicides such as copper sulfate, mancozeb, or chlorothalonil at the first sign of infection or as a preventive measure. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the severity of the disease. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the fungus1 2.
Removing and destroying infected leaves and plants, and keeping the garden free of debris. This can reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease1 2.
Using beneficial microorganisms such as <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em>, or <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> to antagonize or inhibit the growth of the fungus. These can be applied as seed treatments, soil amendments, or foliar sprays3 .
Practicing crop rotation with non-host plants, planting in well-drained and fertile soil, avoiding overcrowding and excessive nitrogen fertilization, maintaining optimal soil pH, and avoiding overhead irrigation or watering in the morning. These can enhance plant health and resistance, and reduce the favorable conditions for the disease1 2 .
["Small, circular, gray to brown spots with dark margins on the leaves", "Enlarged and coalesced spots that cause the leaves to turn yellow and wilt", "Long lesions of greenish-gray on the petioles and stems", "Reduced root size and quality", "Sunscald on exposed roots1 2"]
["Fungal spores (<em>conidia</em>) that are hyaline, cylindrical, and septate, and develop on conidiophores that emerge from the leaf spots.", "Fungal mycelium grows on the surface or inside the infected tissues", "Fungal sclerotia that are black, hard, and irregularly shaped, and form on the stem base or root surface2"]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some studies have reported that <em>Cercospora brassicae</em> can develop resistance to benzimidazole fungicides, such as thiophanate-methyl and carbendazim. The mechanism of resistance involves a mutation in the beta-tubulin gene that reduces the binding affinity of the fungicide1 2. The level of resistance may depend on the frequency and dose of fungicide application, and the genetic diversity of the fungus population2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a microscope to examine the infected leaf tissue for the presence of conidia and conidiophores. The conidia are hyaline, cylindrical, and septate, and form on conidiophores that emerge from the leaf spots. The conidiophores are brown, erect, and branched3 . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but some studies have suggested that <em>Cercospora brassicae </em>produces toxins and enzymes that contribute to its pathogenicity. The toxins may include cercosporin, a polyketide that generates reactive oxygen species and causes oxidative damage to plant cells. The enzymes may include cellulases, pectinases, and proteases that degrade plant cell walls and membrane components. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the strain of the fungus and the host plant species.
