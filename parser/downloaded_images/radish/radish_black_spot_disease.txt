Radish is a horticultural crop that belongs to the crucifer family1. Black spot disease of radish is caused by a fungus-like organism named <em>Aphanomyces raphani</em>2 1. It is also known as black root disease or Aphanomyces root rot1.
The mode of reproduction of Aphanomyces raphani is by zoospores, which are motile spores that can swim in water and infect plant roots1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of black spot disease of radish are influenced by cool, wet soil conditions, which favor the growth and dispersal of zoospores3. The disease can also spread by wind, water splash, insects and animals, as well as by infected seeds and plant debris1.
The period of disease onset for black spot disease of radish can vary depending on the environmental factors and the stage of plant development. The disease can occur at any point in plant development, resulting in seedling death or rotten roots1. However, the symptoms are more noticeable at harvest time, when the roots show dark patches, cracks and fissures that turn necrotic1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool, wet soils with poor drainage and low oxygen levels1. The optimal temperature range for the disease is between 80ВєF and 86 ВєF (27 ВєC-30 ВєC)4. The disease can also be aggravated by high soil acidity, low soil fertility, and root damage by insects or cultivation1.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in soil for 40 to 60 days, or by persisting in plant debris or host plants in the crucifer family1.
Applying fungicides such as copper sulfate1 or other approved products2 on radishes at the first sign of infection or as a preventive measure. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity.
Removing and destroying infected plants and plant debris3 4, as well as cruciferous weeds that can host the disease4. Avoiding overhead watering or sprinkler irrigation that can splash the spores onto the plants2 5.
Using beneficial microorganisms such as <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em> or <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> that can suppress the growth of <em>Aphanomyces raphani</em>.
Practicing crop rotation every 3 years with non-cruciferous crops3 1, sowing seeds in raised beds with good drainage and aeration3 1, maintaining optimal soil pH, fertility, and moisture levels3, and avoiding root damage by insects or cultivation3.
["On leaves: areas that look water-soaked, small spots that are tan or white in color, yellowing at leaf margins in a wedge shape, veins turning black, distortion and withering of leaves3 5.", "On petioles: black, sunken spots that are elongated5.", "On roots: dark patches, cracks and fissures that turn necrotic, rotten roots3."]
["The presence of <em>Aphanomyces raphani</em> zoospores in soil or water samples, which can be detected by microscopy or molecular methods.", "The formation of fungal substrates such as oospores or sporangia on infected plant tissues, which can be observed by microscopy or staining techniques."]
The type and concentration of attractants that induce zoospore chemotaxis and encystment on the host roots. For example, indole-3-aldehyde and prunetin have been identified as attractants of <em>A. raphani</em> and <em>A. euteiches</em> zoospores in cabbage and pea seedlings, respectively1. The presence of resistance genes in the host plants that confer protection against the infection. For example, some radish varieties such as French Breakfast, White Spike, Red Prince, Fuego, and Belle Glade have shown high resistance to black root disease2 3. However, the number, map position, and products of these resistance genes remain unknown1. The interaction of environmental factors such as temperature, soil moisture, pH, fertility, and oxygen levels that affect the growth and survival of the fungus and the host3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is by microscopy or molecular methods. Microscopy can be used to observe the presence of zoospores, oospores, or sporangia on infected plant tissues or soil samples. Molecular methods can be used to detect the DNA or RNA of A. raphani using specific primers or probes1. 
The production and release of zoospores from oospores or sporangia in soil or water. Zoospores are motile spores that can swim towards host roots in response to chemical attractants1. The encystment and germination of zoospores on the root surface, forming a germ tube that penetrates the root cortex through natural openings or wounds1. The colonization and necrosis of root tissues by hyphae that secrete toxins and enzymes that degrade plant cell walls and membranes1. 
The genes involved in root development and defense responses, such as those encoding transcription factors, hormone biosynthesis or signaling proteins, cell wall modification enzymes, pathogenesis-related proteins, etc1. The genes involved in attractant biosynthesis or perception, such as those encoding indole-3-aldehyde or prunetin synthases or receptors1. The genes involved in fungal recognition or resistance, such as those encoding pattern recognition receptors, resistance proteins, or signaling components1.
