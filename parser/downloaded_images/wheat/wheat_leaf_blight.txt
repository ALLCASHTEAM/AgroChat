Wheat is a staple crop that provides food for humans and animals1. Wheat leaf blight is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria triticina2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of wheat leaf blight reproduces by conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of wheat leaf blight are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop residue4. The disease is airborne and can spread from infected plants to healthy ones through spores3.
The period of disease onset for wheat leaf blight is usually during the boot stage of wheat growth, when the flag leaf emerges from the sheath3. The disease can progress rapidly and cause severe damage to the leaves and heads of wheat plants3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, moderate temperature (20-25Г‚В°C), and frequent rainfall3. The disease is also favored by dense planting, poor drainage, and excessive nitrogen fertilization3.
The overwintering method of this disease is through crop residue or infected seeds3. The fungus can survive on the dead plant material or on the seed coat and infect the next crop3.
spraying fungicides such as Mencozeb, Propiconazole, or Nativo at recommended doses and intervals1 2 3. Gloves and face masks should be used when handling chemicals3.
removing and destroying infected plant parts or crop residues to reduce inoculum4.
using antagonistic microorganisms such as Trichoderma or Pseudomonas to suppress the pathogen growth1.
planting resistant varieties, avoiding dense planting, reducing nitrogen fertilization, improving drainage, and avoiding overhead irrigation4 5.

["Dark brown to black conidia of the fungus on the leaf surface or in the lesions1.", "Fungal hyphae growing on the leaf tissue or in the stomata1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well understood, but some studies have reported that the fungus can overcome some of the resistance genes in wheat varieties1. The mechanism of resistance may involve pathogenicity factors such as toxins, cell wall degrading enzymes, and effectors that interact with the host defense system2. The type of resistance agent may be a fungicide that inhibits the fungal growth or spore germination3. The level of resistance may vary depending on the genetic background of the wheat cultivar and the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a microscope to observe the morphology and pigmentation of the fungal spores and hyphae on the infected leaf tissue2. Alternatively, a molecular technique such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to detect the specific DNA sequences of the fungus in the plant samples2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is that the fungus produces conidia that are dispersed by wind or rain and land on the leaf surface2. The conidia germinate and penetrate the leaf tissue through the stomata or through wounds2. The fungus then grows and colonizes the leaf tissue, producing more conidia and causing lesions and necrosis2. The fungus can also produce toxins that damage the plant cells and interfere with the plant defense response2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are not well known, but some studies have identified some potential candidates such as necrosis-inducing proteins, proteases, and lipases2.
