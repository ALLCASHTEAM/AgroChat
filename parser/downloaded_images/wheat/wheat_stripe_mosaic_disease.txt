Wheat is a type of cereal crop that can be classified as a staple crop because it is widely consumed as a staple food by humans1. Wheat streak mosaic disease is caused by Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV), which is a member of the Potyviridae family of viruses2 3. Therefore, it is a viral disease.
WSMV is spread by the wheat curl mite, which feeds on young lush growth of wheat and certain grasses. The mite depends on wind for its dispersal and can move from maturing crops or weeds to newly emerged wheat seedlings in the fall or spring1 2. Therefore, the epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are insect-borne and wind-borne. The period of disease onset for this disease depends on when the plants are infected by the mite and virus. Plants infected before early tillering are stunted, discolored and rosetted. Symptoms usually begin to appear in spring as temperatures warm and become more pronounced as temperatures increase4 2.
disease can range from fall to spring, depending on the environmental conditions and mite population. The environmental conditions required for the disease are those that favor the growth and reproduction of the mite and virus. These include temperatures of 75Г‚В°F to 80Г‚В°F, high humidity, and presence of green hosts such as volunteer wheat, corn, or grassy weeds1 2. Drought stress can also increase the susceptibility of wheat plants to WSMV infection5.
The overwintering method of this disease is through the survival of the mite and virus on living plants such as winter wheat, corn, or grassy weeds that remain green during winter1 2. This creates a "green-bridge" that allows the mite and virus to infect new wheat crops in the spring.
Control volunteer wheat and grassy weeds that emerge before harvest with tillage or herbicides at least two weeks before fall planting. These plants can serve as hosts for the mite and virus and create a "green-bridge" that allows them to infect new wheat crops in the fall or spring1 2 3.
Do not plant winter wheat too early for your growing area. Early planted wheat is more susceptible to mite and virus infestation as they can move from late-maturing crops or weeds to the newly emerged seedlings1 2 3.
Use resistant or tolerant wheat varieties if available. Some wheat varieties have been developed or identified that have resistance or tolerance to WSMV or the wheat curl mite. However, these varieties may not be effective against all strains of the virus or mite, and may lose their resistance over time due to genetic changes in the pathogen or vector2 4.
Rotate crops with non-host plants such as legumes, oilseeds, or broadleaf crops. This can help break the cycle of the mite and virus and reduce their population and survival2 4.

There is no phytopathogenic fungus associated with wheat streak mosaic disease. The disease is caused by Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV), which is a member of the Potyviridae family of viruses1 2. Therefore, this question is not applicable. 
Electron microscopy: This method can visualize the flexuous rods of WSMV that occur in most leaf cells. However, this method requires specialized equipment and expertise, and may not be sensitive enough to detect low levels of virus infection1 2. Serological tests: These tests use antibodies that bind specifically to WSMV antigens and can be detected by color changes or fluorescence signals. Examples of serological tests include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunocapture reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR), and lateral flow devices (LFDs). These tests are more sensitive and specific than electron microscopy, and can be performed in the field or laboratory1 2 3. Molecular tests: These tests use nucleic acid probes or primers that hybridize or amplify specific regions of the WSMV genome. Examples of molecular tests include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), real-time PCR (qPCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). These tests are the most sensitive and specific methods to detect WSMV, but they require sophisticated equipment and expertise, and may not be suitable for field use1 2 3. 
WSMV infection: WSMV enters the plant cells through wounds or natural openings created by the feeding activity of the wheat curl mite. The virus then replicates in the cytoplasm of the cells and moves from cell to cell through plasmodesmata, which are channels that connect adjacent cells. The virus also moves systemically through the phloem, which is the vascular tissue that transports sugars and other substances throughout the plant1 2. WSMV pathogenesis: WSMV causes disease symptoms by interfering with various physiological and biochemical processes in the plant cells. Some of these processes include photosynthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, protein synthesis, hormone balance, gene expression, and cell division. The virus also induces oxidative stress, cell death, and defense responses in the plant1 2 4. Wheat curl mite transmission: The wheat curl mite is a microscopic arachnid that feeds on young lush growth of wheat and certain grasses. The mite acquires WSMV by feeding on infected plants for a few hours, and retains the virus for its entire life span of about two weeks. The mite transmits WSMV by feeding on healthy plants for a few minutes, injecting the virus into the plant cells with its stylet. The mite depends on wind for its dispersal and can move from maturing crops or weeds to newly emerged wheat seedlings in the fall or spring1 2. Wheat curl mite reproduction: The wheat curl mite reproduces by parthenogenesis, which means that females produce offspring without mating with males. The mites develop from eggs to adults within 8 to 10 days, and their numbers can increase markedly during relatively short periods when the environment is favorable. The mites can also enter diapause, which is a state of dormancy that allows them to survive unfavorable conditions such as high or low temperatures or lack of food1 2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not clear.
