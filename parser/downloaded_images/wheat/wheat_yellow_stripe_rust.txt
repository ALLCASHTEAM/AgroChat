Wheat is a staple crop that provides about 20% of the world's dietary energy and protein1. Wheat yellow rust is a fungal disease caused by Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst)2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of wheat yellow rust reproduces by producing urediniospores that are dispersed by wind and infect wheat leaves2 4. It also produces teliospores that can infect barberry plants, which are the alternate hosts of the fungus1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of wheat yellow rust are influenced by airborne spores, weather conditions, host resistance, and pathogen variation5 4. The disease can spread rapidly over long distances by windborne spores4.
The period of disease onset for wheat yellow rust varies depending on the region, but it usually occurs early in the growth season, when temperature ranges between 2 and 15 Г‚В°C (36 and 59 Г‚В°F); but it may occur to a maximum of 23 Г‚В°C (73 Г‚В°F)1 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool and moist weather, high humidity, and dew formation on the leaves2 4. The disease is favored by temperatures between 10 and 15 Г‚В°C (50 and 59 Г‚В°F) and relative humidity above 75%2.
The overwintering method of wheat yellow rust is by surviving on volunteer wheat plants, barberry plants, or infected seed2 4. The fungus can also survive in warmer regions by migrating to higher altitudes or latitudes2.
Selecting resistant varieties that are region specific and adapted to the local climate and disease pressure1 2.
Early planting to avoid the peak period of yellow rust infection and allow wheat to mature before the disease spreads1.
Good agronomic practices, such as proper planting density, appropriate irrigation and timely weed control, to reduce the favorable conditions for yellow rust development1 2.
Fungicide applications when the disease is detected or when there is a high risk of infection. Combinations of both triazoles and strobilurins class fungicides can be sprayed to get best results1 3. The timing and frequency of fungicide applications depend on the disease severity, weather conditions and crop growth stage. A multisite protective fungicide like chlorothalonil can also be used for septoria control3.
["Yellow streaks on the leaves, leaf sheaths, glumes and awns, followed by small, bright yellow, elongated uredial pustules arranged in conspicuous rows (Figure 1)4.", "Long, narrow yellow stripes on the leaves in some varieties4.", "Brown and dry tissues as the plant matures or becomes stressed4.", "Plant stunting in case of severe early infection4."]
["Yellow-orange masses of urediniospores that are released from the mature pustules and can be seen on the plant surface or transferred to other plants by wind or rain4.", "Teliospores that are produced late in the season and have a dark brown color and a thick wall. They are usually found at the base of the uredial pustules or on dead tissues4."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of the disease, Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst), has a complex mechanism of resistance that involves multiple genes and effectors. The type of resistance agent depends on the host plant and the pathogen strain. The level of resistance varies among different wheat cultivars and regions. Some of the factors that affect the resistance of Pst are: 1 2.The presence or absence of specific resistance (R) genes in the host plant that recognize corresponding avirulence (Avr) genes in the pathogen. The expression and evolution of Avr genes in the pathogen that can overcome or evade the recognition by R genes. The presence or absence of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in the host plant that confer partial or durable resistance to Pst. The interaction and combination of R genes and QTLs in the host plant that can enhance or reduce the resistance level. The environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and solar radiation that can influence the infection and development of Pst. A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use molecular markers such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect and identify Pst DNA or RNA in infected plant samples. These methods are rapid, sensitive, specific, and cost-effective compared to traditional methods such as microscopy or inoculation. 3 4 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the following steps: The dispersal and deposition of Pst urediniospores on the leaf surface of susceptible wheat plants by wind currents. The germination and penetration of Pst urediniospores through stomata or wounds on the leaf surface within 4 to 6 hours after infection. The formation and growth of Pst hyphae and haustoria inside the leaf mesophyll cells, which extract nutrients and suppress host defense responses. The differentiation and emergence of Pst uredinia on the leaf surface within 7 to 14 days after infection, which produce new urediniospores that can infect other plants. The production and release of Pst teliospores on senescent leaves at the end of the growing season, which can infect barberry plants as an alternate host and complete the sexual cycle of Pst. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors produced by Pst are not fully known, but some examples are: Avr genes that trigger R gene-mediated resistance or susceptibility in host plants depending on their compatibility; Secreted in xylem (SIX) genes that encode small secreted proteins that modulate host immunity and virulence; Cysteine-rich secreted proteins (CRSPs) that have diverse functions in pathogenicity and host adaptation; Cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) that facilitate fungal penetration and colonization of host tissues. 
The differences in infestation of different plants by Pst depend on several factors such as: The genetic diversity and virulence variation of Pst populations in different regions and seasons. The genetic diversity and resistance variation of wheat cultivars and other cereal crops in different regions and seasons. The phenotypic plasticity and environmental adaptation of Pst and wheat plants in response to changing climatic conditions. The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not clear, as there is no evidence that bacteria are involved in causing wheat yellow rust. However, some studies have suggested that bacteria may play a role in enhancing or suppressing Pst infection by interacting with wheat plants or Pst spores. For example: Some plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) can induce systemic resistance (ISR) in wheat plants against Pst by activating defense-related genes and pathways; Some endophytic bacteria can inhibit Pst growth and sporulation by producing antimicrobial compounds or competing for nutrients and space; Some epiphytic bacteria can promote Pst infection by facilitating spore germination or suppressing plant immunity.
