Wheat is a staple crop that is widely cultivated for its grain, which is used to make flour, bread, pasta, and other food products1. Wheat crustose leaf blight is a fungal disease caused by the fungus <em>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis2</em>. It is also known as a tan spot or yellow leaf spot or blotch1.
The pathogenic fungus of wheat crustose leaf blight reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain splash2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of wheat crustose leaf blight are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop residue3. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions, and in fields with high amounts of infected wheat stubble that serve as a source of inoculum1. The conidia can infect wheat leaves through natural openings or wounds, and cause necrotic lesions that reduce photosynthesis and yield2.
The period of disease onset for wheat crustose leaf blight varies depending on the crop stage and the environmental conditions. The disease can infect wheat at any growth stage, but it is more common and damaging during the late vegetative and early reproductive stages2. The disease can develop within 7 to 10 days after infection under favorable conditions1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are temperatures between 15Г‚В°C and 25Г‚В°C, relative humidity above 90%, and frequent rainfall or irrigation events that create leaf wetness for at least 6 hours2. The disease is less severe in dry and cool climates, or in fields with adequate crop rotation and residue management practices1.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected wheat stubble or seeds that remain in the soil or on the surface2. The fungus can also survive on alternative hosts such as barley, rye, oats, and some grasses1.
Applying antifungal agents such as itraconazole, chloramphenicol, or voriconazole to infected individuals or water sources1 2. However, this method may have negative effects on the amphibian skin microbiome, which plays a role in host defense1. Moreover, chemical control may not be feasible or effective at large scales or in natural settings1.
Removing infected individuals from the population and treating them in captivity, or euthanizing them to prevent further transmission1 2. This method may reduce the pathogen load in the environment, but it may also have negative impacts on the population dynamics and genetic diversity of amphibians1.
Enhancing the amphibian skin microbiome with probiotic bacteria that can inhibit or compete with the chytrid fungus1 2. This method may enhance the host resistance to infection, but it may also pose risks of introducing non-native bacteria or disrupting the natural microbial balance1.
Reducing the environmental stressors that may increase the susceptibility of amphibians to infection, such as habitat loss, pollution, climate change, invasive species, or overexploitation1 2. This method may improve the overall health and resilience of amphibian populations, but it may not be sufficient to prevent or eradicate the disease1.
["Anorexia and lethargy: infected amphibians may lose appetite and become less active3 4.", "Skin abnormalities: infected amphibians may experience excessive shedding of skin, which appears opaque and gray-white or tan in color. They may also develop red skin, convulsions, lack of righting reflex (a reflex that corrects the orientation of the body after it has been taken out of its normal upright position), abnormal feeding behavior, and discoloration near the mouth3 4.", "Mortality: infected amphibians may die from cardiac arrest or electrolyte imbalance caused by impaired osmoregulation and respiration through their water-permeable skin3 4."]
["<em>Sporangia</em>: these are spherical structures that contain numerous zoospores (asexual spores) that are produced by the chytrid fungus. They can be seen under a microscope as dark spots on the skin surface or within the epidermal cells3 4.", "PCR test: this is a molecular technique that can detect the presence of chytrid DNA in skin swabs or tissue samples."]
