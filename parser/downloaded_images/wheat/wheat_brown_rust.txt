Wheat is a type of cereal crop that can be used for food, feed, or biofuel. It is one of the most widely cultivated crops in the world and a staple food for many people1. Wheat leaf embroidery disease is a type of fungal disease caused by the pathogen Microdochium nivale1. It is also known as pink snow mold, Fusarium patch, or Microdochium patch1.
The pathogenic fungus of wheat leaf embroidery disease reproduces by producing conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind, water, or infected plant debris1. The conidia can germinate and infect wheat leaves under cool and moist conditions1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of wheat leaf embroidery disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, snow cover, and crop residue2. The disease is more severe in regions with cold winters and prolonged snow cover, where the fungus can grow and infect wheat plants under the snow1. The disease can also spread by rain splash, irrigation, or mechanical contact with infected plant material1.
The period of disease onset for wheat leaf embroidery disease varies depending on the climatic conditions and the susceptibility of the wheat cultivar1. The disease can occur at any stage of wheat growth, but it is more common in the fall and spring when the temperatures are between 0Г‚В°C and 15Г‚В°C and the humidity is high1. The disease can cause leaf lesions, leaf blight, crown rot, and reduced yield and quality1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool and moist conditions that favor the germination of conidia and the infection of wheat leaves1. The optimal temperature range for the fungus is between 0Г‚В°C and 15Г‚В°C, and the optimal moisture level is above 90% relative humidity1. The disease is less likely to occur in hot and dry conditions or in well-drained soils1.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving as mycelium or conidia on infected plant debris or in the soil1. The fungus can also overwinter on living wheat plants under snow cover or in sheltered areas1. The fungus can remain viable for several months or years in the soil or on crop residue1.
Applying fungicides such as pyraclostrobin, azoxystrobin, propiconazole, or mancozeb at the recommended rates and timings can help reduce the severity and spread of the disease1 2. Fungicides should be applied before or at the first sign of infection, and may need to be repeated depending on the disease pressure and environmental conditions1 2. Fungicides can also be used as seed treatments to protect the seedlings from early infection3.
Removing or burying infected plant debris or crop residue can help reduce the inoculum source and the overwintering of the fungus4. Avoiding excessive irrigation or improving drainage can help reduce the moisture level and prevent favorable conditions for the disease4.
Using antagonistic microorganisms such as Trichoderma harzianum or Bacillus subtilis can help suppress the growth and infection of the fungus4. These biocontrol agents can be applied as seed treatments, soil amendments, or foliar sprays4.
Planting disease-resistant or tolerant wheat cultivars can help reduce the susceptibility and yield loss due to the disease5 4. Rotating wheat with non-host crops such as corn, soybean, or legumes can help break the disease cycle and reduce the inoculum level4. Avoiding planting wheat too early or too densely can help reduce the risk of infection and improve air circulation4.

["Disease signs of this disease include mycelium (white, cottony growth) and conidia (pinkish, oval spores) of the fungus that can be seen on the leaf surface with a hand lens or microscope4. The mycelium and conidia may form a mat-like structure that binds the leaves together under snow cover or high humidity4."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus can develop resistance to fungicides by altering the target site of the fungicide, increasing the efflux of the fungicide, or degrading the fungicide1 2. The fungus can also adapt to different wheat cultivars by changing its virulence factors2. Type of resistance agent: The fungus can show resistance to different classes of fungicides, such as quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), demethylation inhibitors (DMIs), or succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs)1 2. These fungicides inhibit different enzymes involved in fungal respiration or sterol biosynthesis1 2. Level of resistance: The level of resistance can vary depending on the fungicide class, the fungal population, and the environmental conditions1 2. Some studies have reported high levels of resistance to QoIs and moderate to high levels of resistance to DMIs in some regions1 2. Resistance to SDHIs has also been detected but at lower levels1 2. 
One possible method is to use a molecular assay based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect specific DNA sequences of the fungus in infected plant samples3. This method can be rapid, sensitive, and specific, but it requires specialized equipment and reagents3. Another possible method is to use a bioassay based on growing fungal isolates on agar plates containing different concentrations of fungicides and measuring their growth inhibition4. This method can be simple and inexpensive, but it requires more time and labor4. 
The fungus infects wheat leaves by producing conidia (asexual spores) that land on the leaf surface and germinate under moist conditions2. The conidia produce appressoria (specialized infection structures) that penetrate the leaf cuticle and epidermis by mechanical pressure and enzymatic degradation2. The fungus then grows inside the leaf tissue by producing hyphae (fungal filaments) that invade the intercellular spaces and colonize the mesophyll cells2. The fungus feeds on the plant nutrients by secreting cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) and effectors (small proteins that modulate plant defense responses)2. The fungus produces different types of effectors, such as necrotrophic effectors (NEs) that induce cell death and tissue necrosis, or biotrophic effectors (BEs) that suppress plant immunity and prolong host viability2. The fungus can also produce toxins that contribute to disease development2. 
One possible target is the fungal respiration chain, which is essential for fungal energy production and survival1. Fungicides that inhibit this target, such as QoIs or SDHIs, can effectively kill the fungus or reduce its growth1. Another possible target is the fungal sterol biosynthesis, which is important for fungal membrane structure and function1. Fungicides that inhibit this target, such as DMIs, can disrupt fungal membrane integrity and permeability1. A third possible target is the fungal CWDEs, which are involved in plant cell wall degradation and nutrient acquisition5. Inhibiting these enzymes can reduce fungal virulence and host damage5.
