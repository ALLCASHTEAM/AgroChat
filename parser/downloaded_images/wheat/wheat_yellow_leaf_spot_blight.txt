Wheat is a staple crop that is widely cultivated for its grain, which is used to make flour, bread, pasta, and other food products1 2. Wheat yellow spot leaf blight is a fungal disease caused by <em>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</em> (also known as <em>Drechslera tritici-repentis</em> or tan spot fungus) 3 4.
The pathogenic fungus of wheat yellow spot leaf blight reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain splash 3 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of wheat yellow spot leaf blight are influenced by the presence of infected wheat stubble, which serves as the primary source of inoculum for the fungus. The fungus survives on wheat stubble and produces flase sexual fruiting bodies called <em>pseudothecia</em>, which eject ascospores onto nearby seedlings after rain. The ascospores germinate and infect the leaves, producing conidia that can infect new leaves or other wheat paddocks by wind or rain splash 5 4.
The period of disease onset for wheat yellow spot leaf blight depends on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the wheat cultivar. The disease can occur at any stage of wheat growth, but it is more severe when infection occurs early in the season, before stem elongation 3 4. The environmental conditions required for wheat yellow spot leaf blight are high humidity, moderate temperature (15-25Г‚В°C), and frequent rainfall or irrigation. These conditions favor the production and dispersal of spores and the infection of leaves 3 4.
The overwintering method of wheat yellow spot leaf blight is by surviving on wheat stubble as pseudothecia or mycelium. The fungus can also survive on infected seeds, but this is less common 3 4.
Fungicides such as propiconazole, tebuconazole, prothioconazole and azoxystrobin can be applied at the flag leaf emergence or booting stage to reduce disease severity and yield loss. The application dose, number of applications and control effect may vary depending on the product label, disease pressure and environmental conditions.
Removing or burning infected stubble can reduce the inoculum source for the next season. Crop rotation with non-host crops such as canola, lupin or legume pastures can also help break the disease cycle.
There is limited information on biological control agents for this disease. Some studies have reported that antagonistic bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens can inhibit the growth of the fungus in vitro, but their efficacy in the field is unknown.
Planting resistant or tolerant varieties can reduce the impact of the disease. Avoiding early sowing and high seeding rates can also reduce disease development by minimizing leaf wetness and humidity.

["<em>Pycnidia</em>: small, flask-shaped structures that produce asexual spores (<em>conidia</em>) of the fungus. They are visible as black specks within the lesions on leaves.", "<em>Perithecia</em>: small, spherical structures that produce sexual spores (ascospores) of the fungus. They are formed on infected stubble after harvest and are visible as black dots on the surface of the stubble."]
According to 1, the phytopathogenic fungus of wheat yellow spot leaf blight is <em>Parastagonospora nodorum</em> (formerly known as <em>Stagonospora nodorum</em>). This fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs). The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the target genes of the fungicides, such as cytochrome b and succinate dehydrogenase subunits. The level of resistance may vary depending on the frequency and distribution of the resistant isolates and the fungicide dose and timing. 
According to 2, a quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of wheat yellow spot leaf blight is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers that amplify a region of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA. This method can detect the fungus from infected leaves or stubble within a few hours. 
According to 3 and 4, the mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of wheat yellow spot leaf blight involves the production and secretion of necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by the fungus. NEs are small proteins that trigger cell death and tissue necrosis in susceptible wheat plants. The fungus then feeds on the dead plant tissue and produces more spores. The type and number of NEs produced by the fungus may vary depending on the isolate and the environmental conditions. Some NEs have been identified and characterized, such as SnToxA, SnTox1, SnTox2, SnTox3 and SnTox4. The infestation of different plants may depend on their sensitivity or resistance to these NEs, which is determined by their genetic makeup.
