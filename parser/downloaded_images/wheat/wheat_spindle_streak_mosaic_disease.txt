Wheat is the type of crop of this plant. It is a staple crop that is widely grown for human consumption and animal feed1 2. Wheat pokeweed mosaic disease is caused by Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), which is a viral disease that infects plants in the family Poaceae1 2.
WSMV is transmitted by the wheat curl mite (Aceria tosichella), which is a tiny eriophyid mite that feeds on wheat and other grasses1 3. The mite does not reproduce the virus, but acquires it from infected plants and carries it to new hosts3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by the presence of volunteer wheat, grassy weeds, and corn that serve as alternative hosts for the mite and the virus4 3. The mite spreads by wind and can move long distances from infested fields to newly planted wheat crops1 3. The disease is more common in areas where spring and winter wheat overlap1.
The period of disease onset for this disease depends on when the plants are infected by the mite and the virus. Plants can be infected in fall or spring, but symptoms usually begin to appear in spring as temperatures warm1. Symptoms are less pronounced and can be difficult to discern when temperatures are less than 70Г‚В°F but become more pronounced as temperatures increase1. Symptoms are similar in spring wheat but progress more quickly1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and dry weather that favors the mite population growth and virus replication3. The disease is also favored by longer and warmer fall temperatures that allow the mite to spread the virus from volunteer plants to the newly planted winter wheat crop1.
The overwintering method of this disease is through living plants that harbor the mite and the virus. These include volunteer wheat, corn, and many other grasses such as barnyardgrass1. The mite and the virus do not survive in soil or plant debris5.
There are no pesticides that provide effective control of the wheat curl mites that spread wheat streak mosaic virus1 2. However, some insecticides may reduce the mite population temporarily and delay the disease development3.
Cutting off infected parts of the plant is not a feasible option for this disease, as the virus can infect the whole plant and the mite can move to new hosts easily3.
There are no known biological agents that can control the wheat curl mite or the wheat streak mosaic virus3.
The most important and effective management technique for this disease is to eliminate the вЂњgreen bridgeвЂќ of volunteer wheat and other grassy hosts of the virus and the mite before planting4 5 3. This can be done by applying herbicides, tillage, or grazing at least two weeks before planting5 3. Planting resistant varieties may also reduce losses, but resistance may not be complete or durable5 3. Planting date can also affect the disease severity, as early planted winter wheat is more susceptible to infection than late planted winter wheat5 3.
["Stunting of infected plants, which may be splayed on the ground and do not tiller as well as healthy plants5. Foliar symptoms such as a light green to yellow mottled mosaic; more advanced infections may develop yellow streaks running parallel to the veins5. Symptoms are more pronounced when temperatures are above 70в„ѓand less visible when temperatures are below 70в„ѓ5. Tightly rolled and trapped leaves that result from feeding damage by large numbers of wheat curl mites5. Sterile wheat heads that result from severe infections that reduce yield potential and quality3."]
["Wheat curl mites that can be seen under high magnification on the leaf surface or leaf sheath. They are very small (less than 0.25 mm long), white to yellow in color, and have two pairs of legs at the front end of their elongated body3. Virus particles that can be detected by laboratory tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on plant tissue samples5."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic virus of the disease is mainly conferred by resistance genes in wheat or its wild relatives. There are three known resistance genes: Wsm1, Wsm2, and Wsm3, which are located on different chromosomes and confer different levels of resistance1 2. The mechanism of resistance is not fully understood, but it may involve recognition of viral effectors by plant receptors and activation of defense responses2. There are no known resistance agents that can be applied to control the virus infection3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic virus of the disease is to use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on plant tissue samples. These methods can detect the presence of viral antigens or nucleic acids, respectively, and confirm the diagnosis of the disease. 
The virus is acquired by the wheat curl mite from infected plants and carried to new hosts. The mite feeds on the leaf surface or leaf sheath and injects the virus into the plant cells. The virus replicates in the plant cells and moves through the plasmodesmata (cell-to-cell connections) to infect neighboring cells. The virus also moves through the phloem (vascular tissue) to infect distant parts of the plant. The virus expresses several proteins that interfere with plant defense mechanisms and facilitate viral infection and movement. These proteins include a helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) that suppresses gene silencing, a P1 protein that inhibits RNA degradation, a P3 protein that interacts with plant receptors, a 6K2 protein that induces membrane proliferation, a nuclear inclusion a (NIa) protein that cleaves the viral polyprotein, a nuclear inclusion b (NIb) protein that encodes the viral RNA polymerase, and a coat protein (CP) that protects the viral genome and mediates cell-to-cell movement. The virus causes various symptoms in different plants depending on the virus strain, the plant variety, the age of infection, and the environmental conditions. Some common symptoms include stunting, mottling, streaking, rolling, and sterility of wheat plants. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not clear.
