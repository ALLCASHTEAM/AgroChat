Wheat is a type of cereal crop that can be used for food, feed, and biofuel production. Wheat can be classified as a staple crop because it is a major source of carbohydrates and protein for human consumption1. Wheat spot blight is a type of fungal disease caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana (also known as Cochliobolus sativus) 2 1. This fungus can also cause common root rot and black point diseases in wheat 2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of wheat spot blight is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in large numbers on the surface of infected plant tissues 2 1. The conidia are dispersed by wind, rain, or irrigation water to new hosts 1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of wheat spot blight are influenced by several factors, such as temperature, humidity, crop rotation, tillage, residue management, and cultivar resistance 1 3. The disease is more severe in warmer and humid areas where wheat is grown under continuous or intensive cropping systems with minimum or zero tillage 1 3. The disease can also be transmitted by infected seeds or contaminated soil 2 1.
The period of disease onset for wheat spot blight varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the cultivar. The disease can start at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common and damaging during the late vegetative and early reproductive stages 1 3. The disease can reduce grain yield and quality by affecting photosynthesis, grain filling, and seed germination 1 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30Г‚В°C) and high relative humidity (80-100%) 1 3. These conditions favor the germination of conidia and the infection of plant tissues. The disease is less severe in cooler and drier climates or under irrigation regimes that reduce leaf wetness duration 1 3.
The overwintering method of wheat spot blight is by surviving on crop residues, such as straw, stubble, or chaff, that remain on the soil surface after harvest 2 1. The fungus can also survive on alternative hosts, such as barley, oats, rye, or grasses, that are grown in rotation with wheat or as weeds 2 1.
fungicides such as Mencozeb or Propiconazole can be sprayed at recommended doses and intervals to reduce disease severity and DON accumulation 1. However, fungicides are not very effective against wheat spot blight and should be used in combination with other management practices 2.
removing or burying infected crop residues can reduce the inoculum source and disease pressure for the next season 2. Cutting off infected parts of the plant is not practical or feasible for wheat spot blight.
some antagonistic microorganisms, such as Trichoderma harzianum or Pseudomonas fluorescens, have been reported to suppress wheat spot blight and reduce DON levels 3 4. However, their efficacy and consistency under field conditions need further evaluation and improvement.
using certified seeds and disease-resistant varieties, rotating with non-host crops, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, and adjusting sowing dates and plant densities can help reduce the risk and impact of wheat spot blight 2 4.

Mechanism of resistance: the fungus can overcome the host resistance by producing different pathogenic effectors that can suppress or evade the plant defense responses 1. The fungus can also produce mycotoxins that can interfere with the plant metabolism and physiology 2. Type of resistance agent: the fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides that are used to control wheat spot blight, such as azoles and strobilurins 3 4. The resistance can be due to mutations in the target genes or enzymes, or enhanced detoxification mechanisms 3 4. Level of resistance: the level of resistance can vary depending on the fungal strain, the fungicide dose and frequency, and the environmental conditions 3 4. Some studies have reported moderate to high levels of resistance to azoles and strobilurins in some populations of Bipolaris sorokiniana 3 4. 
Molecular detection: molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) can be used to detect and identify the fungus from infected plant tissues or seeds . These methods are rapid, sensitive, and specific, but require specialized equipment and reagents . Immunological detection: immunological techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) can be used to detect and quantify the fungus or its mycotoxins from infected plant tissues or seeds . These methods are simple, inexpensive, and portable, but may have lower sensitivity and specificity than molecular methods . 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: the fungus can produce several types of pathogenic effectors that can modulate the plant immune system and facilitate infection. Some examples are: Bip1, a necrosis-inducing protein that can trigger cell death and tissue necrosis in susceptible plants . BcSpl1, a cerato-platanin protein that can induce oxidative stress and alter plant cell wall integrity . BcXyl1, a xylanase enzyme that can degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides and release nutrients for fungal growth . BcSnod1, a small secreted protein that can suppress plant defense responses by interfering with salicylic acid signaling . Differences in infestation of different plants: the fungus can infect different cereal crops, such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, and rice, but with different levels of susceptibility and severity. Wheat is considered the most susceptible host, followed by barley and oats. Rye and rice are relatively resistant to the fungus 2. The differences in infestation may be due to genetic variation in host resistance genes or fungal virulence factors 2.
