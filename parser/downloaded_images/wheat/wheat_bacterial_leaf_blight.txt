Pumpkin is a type of horticultural crop, which means it is grown for ornamental or culinary purposes1. Powdery mildew is a type of fungal disease, caused by different species of fungi that belong to the order Erysiphales2.
The pathogenic fungi of powdery mildew reproduce by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that can be dispersed by wind or insects2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of powdery mildew are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light. The disease is more prevalent in warm, dry, and shady conditions, and can spread by airborne conidia or by contact with infected plant parts3 4.
The period of disease onset for powdery mildew varies depending on the crop and the pathogen, but generally it can occur from early to late summer, when the plants start to produce fruit4. The symptoms first appear as white spots on the lower surface of the leaves, which can expand and cover the entire leaf surface5. The environmental conditions required for the disease are temperatures between 60-80 F (15-26 C), high humidity (above 70%), and low light intensity5 4. These conditions favor the germination and growth of the conidia and the infection of the plant tissues4.
The overwintering method of powdery mildew depends on the pathogen species and the host plant. Some fungi can survive on plant debris or on living hosts, while others can form sexual spores called chasmothecia that can endure harsh conditions2 4.
There are various fungicides that can be used to prevent or treat powdery mildew on pumpkins, such as sulfur, copper, neem oil, jojoba oil, and other horticultural oils1 2. Some fungicides have a protectant effect, which means they prevent the infection from occurring, while others have an eradicant effect, which means they kill the existing fungus1. It is important to follow the label instructions for the type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect. It is also advisable to rotate different fungicides with different modes of action to avoid resistance development by the fungus3.
One of the simplest ways to control powdery mildew is to remove the infected leaves, vines, or blossoms as soon as they are noticed1. This can reduce the spread of the disease and allow the plant to produce more pumpkins. However, this method may not be effective if the infection is severe or widespread. The removed plant parts should be disposed of properly and not composted to avoid further contamination2.
There are some biological agents that can be used to suppress powdery mildew on pumpkins, such as beneficial bacteria or fungi that compete with or parasitize the pathogen2. For example, Bacillus subtilis and Ampelomyces quisqualis are two microorganisms that have been shown to reduce powdery mildew on cucurbits4. However, biological control may not be as effective or consistent as chemical control, and may require more frequent applications2.
There are some cultural practices that can help prevent or reduce powdery mildew on pumpkins, such as planting resistant varieties, avoiding excess fertilization, providing adequate spacing and ventilation, watering at the base of the plant and not on the foliage, and avoiding overhead irrigation or wetting the leaves1 2. These practices can improve the plant health and reduce the favorable conditions for the fungus.

The type of resistance agent: Different fungicides have different modes of action and target different metabolic pathways or structures of the fungus. For example, sulfur and copper act as protectants that inhibit spore germination and mycelial growth, while neem oil and jojoba oil act as eradicants that disrupt the cell membrane and interfere with respiration1 2. Some fungicides belong to the same chemical group and have similar modes of action, such as QoI fungicides (FRAC Group 11) that inhibit mitochondrial respiration3. The mechanism of resistance: The fungus can develop resistance to a fungicide by various mechanisms, such as mutation, gene duplication, efflux pumps, detoxification enzymes, or target site modification3. For example, QoI-resistant strains of the fungus have a mutation in the cytochrome b gene that prevents the binding of the fungicide to the target site3. The level of resistance: The level of resistance refers to the degree to which the fungus can tolerate or overcome the effect of a fungicide. It can be measured by the EC50 value, which is the concentration of the fungicide that reduces fungal growth by 50% compared to the control3. The level of resistance can vary depending on the fungicide, the fungal strain, and the environmental conditions. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a microscope to observe the spores and mycelia on the infected plant parts. The spores are oval or cylindrical and are produced in chains on short stalks called conidiophores4. The mycelia are thin and branched filaments that grow on the surface of the plant tissue4. Another method is to use molecular techniques such as PCR or DNA sequencing to identify the fungal species or strain based on specific genetic markers5. 
The type and number of pathogen effectors: Effectors are molecules secreted by the fungus that can manipulate or suppress the plant defense responses4. Some effectors can act as avirulence factors that trigger a hypersensitive reaction in resistant plants, while others can act as virulence factors that enhance fungal colonization in susceptible plants4. The fungus may produce different types or numbers of effectors depending on the host plant or the environmental conditions4. The differences in infestation of different plants: Different plants may have different levels of susceptibility or resistance to powdery mildew depending on their genetic makeup and physiological state4. Some plants may have specific resistance genes that recognize certain effectors and activate defense mechanisms, while others may have general resistance traits that reduce fungal growth or spread4. Some plants may also have different morphological or biochemical features that affect fungal attachment or penetration4. 
Knockout lethal genes: These are genes that are essential for fungal survival or pathogenicity, and their disruption or deletion would result in reduced fitness or virulence. For example, some genes involved in cell wall synthesis, signal transduction, metabolism, or stress response may be potential knockout lethal genes for powdery mildew. Host susceptibility genes: These are genes that facilitate fungal infection or colonization in the plant host, and their silencing or mutation would result in increased resistance or tolerance. For example, some genes involved in cell cycle regulation, hormone signaling, transcription factors, or transporters may be potential host susceptibility genes for powdery mildew.
