Wheat is a staple crop that provides about 20% of the world's dietary energy1. Wheat powdery mildew is a fungal disease caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici2 3 4 5.
The pathogenic fungus of wheat powdery mildew reproduces asexually by producing conidia (spores) that are dispersed by wind and infect new host plants2 3. It also reproduces sexually by forming chasmothecia (fruiting bodies) that contain ascospores that can survive harsh conditions and infect in the fall and early spring3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of wheat powdery mildew are influenced by environmental factors, host resistance, and pathogen variability4. The disease is mainly transmitted by airborne conidia that germinate and penetrate the host epidermis within hours of landing on a susceptible leaf surface6 4. The disease cycle can be completed in 7-10 days under favorable conditions, leading to multiple infection cycles in a growing season2 4.
The period of disease onset for wheat powdery mildew varies depending on the region, climate, and cropping system. In Ohio, for example, the disease is most prevalent on the lower leaves of susceptible varieties in late April or early May when wheat is in the joint to flag-leaf stage of development3. In Western Australia, however, the disease can appear as early as June or July on early-sown crops5. The environmental conditions required for the disease are mild temperatures, high relative humidity, and dense stands of wheat2 3 5. The optimal temperature range for conidial germination and infection is 15-22В°C, and the optimal relative humidity is above 95%2 4. High nitrogen fertilization and irrigation can also increase the susceptibility of wheat to powdery mildew2 5.
The overwintering method of this disease is by producing chasmothecia on infected plant debris or volunteer wheat plants3. Chasmothecia can survive low temperatures and drought, and release ascospores in the fall or early spring when conditions are favorable for infection3.
Fungicides can be applied to protect susceptible varieties from infection or to reduce disease severity and prevent yield loss. The type, dose, timing, and number of applications depend on the fungicide label, the disease pressure, the crop growth stage, and the cost-benefit analysis. Some examples of fungicides registered for wheat powdery mildew control are triazoles (e.g., propiconazole, tebuconazole), strobilurins (e.g., azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin), and mixtures of both1 .
Removing or destroying infected plant debris or volunteer wheat plants can reduce the inoculum sources for the next season. Avoiding excessive irrigation or nitrogen fertilization can also reduce the susceptibility of wheat to powdery mildew2 1 .
There are some natural enemies of wheat powdery mildew, such as parasitic fungi (e.g., Ampelomyces quisqualis) and predatory mites (e.g., Typhlodromus pyri), but their effectiveness and availability are limited3.
Planting resistant varieties, rotating crops with non-hosts, sowing at optimal dates and densities, and using certified seeds can help prevent or reduce the incidence and severity of wheat powdery mildew2 1 .

The phytopathogenic fungus of wheat powdery mildew is Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) 1 2. It has developed resistance to several fungicides, such as triazoles, strobilurins and morpholines 3. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the target genes or increased expression of efflux pumps 3. The type of resistance agent depends on the mode of action of the fungicide, such as demethylation inhibitors (DMI), quinone outside inhibitors (QoI) or sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (SBI) 3. The level of resistance varies depending on the geographic location, the fungicide dose and the fungal population 3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of wheat powdery mildew is to use a molecular diagnostic tool called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) 3. This method can detect Bgt DNA in infected plant samples within 30 minutes without the need for expensive equipment or skilled personnel 3. LAMP can also differentiate between Bgt and other formae speciales of Blumeria graminis that infect other cereals 3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of wheat powdery mildew involves the formation of a specialized structure called a haustorium that penetrates the plant cell wall and extracts nutrients from the host 2 3. Bgt produces pathogenic effectors that modulate the plant immune system and facilitate infection 2 3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are estimated to be around 500, based on genome analysis 2 3. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host specificity of Bgt and its ability to overcome plant resistance genes 2 3. 
п‚·TheВ potential targetsВ of the phytopathogenic bacteria of wheat powdery mildew are not well known, as Bgt is not a bacterial pathogen but a fungal pathogen. However, some studies have identified genes that are essential for Bgt survival and virulence, such as genes involved in cell wall synthesis, signal transduction, metabolism and effector secretionВ 2В 3. These genes could be considered asВ knockout lethal genesВ that could impair Bgt growth and infection if disrupted.
