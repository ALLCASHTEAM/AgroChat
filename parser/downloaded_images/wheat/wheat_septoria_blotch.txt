Type of crop: Wheat is a staple crop that provides food for humans and animals. It is one of the most widely cultivated cereal crops in the world1. Type of disease: Wheat Septoria blotch is a fungal disease caused by the ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola (asexual stage: Septoria tritici)1 2.
Mode of reproduction: The pathogenic fungus reproduces both sexually and asexually. The sexual stage produces pseudothecia that contain ascospores, which are wind-dispersed and can initiate new infections. The asexual stage produces pycnidia that contain conidia, which are rain-splashed and can cause secondary infections1 2. Epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission: Wheat Septoria blotch is a polycyclic disease that can have several cycles of infection within a growing season. The primary inoculum comes from pseudothecia on infected crop residues or volunteer plants. The ascospores are released during wet periods and carried by wind to infect new leaves. The secondary inoculum comes from pycnidia on infected leaves. The conidia are released during rain events and splashed to infect adjacent leaves or plants. The disease spreads from lower to upper leaves as the season progresses1 3.
Period of disease onset: Wheat Septoria blotch can infect wheat plants at any stage of development, but symptoms usually appear on lower leaves in the fall and early spring. The disease becomes more severe during cool and wet weather, especially during late spring and early summer1 2. Environmental conditions required for the disease: Wheat Septoria blotch favors temperatures between 15В°C and 25В°C and relative humidity above 90%. Frequent rainfall or irrigation also promotes the disease development1 2.
Overwintering method: Wheat Septoria blotch overwinters as pseudothecia or pycnidia on infected crop residues or volunteer plants. The pseudothecia can survive for up to two years in the soil, while the pycnidia can survive for up to one year1 2.
Crop rotation to reduce the risk from stubble-borne diseases1.
Variety selection to avoid very susceptible or susceptible varieties and favour moderately resistant-moderately susceptible varieties1 2.
Adequate nutrition (particularly nitrogen and potassium) to ensure crop health1.
Fungicide applications to protect the flag leaf and ear during the critical growth stages2 3. Some examples of fungicides are azoxystrobin/metalaxyl-M active (e.g. Uniform) for seed treatment4, prothioconazole/fluopyram (e.g. Aviator Xpro) or epoxiconazole/pyraclostrobin (e.g. Opera) for foliar spray3. The application dose, period, number and effect depend on the disease pressure, weather conditions, variety resistance and fungicide efficacy3.
["Small chlorotic spots on the leaves that appear soon after seedlings emerge in the fall or spring2.", "Light tan lesions that enlarge and become long, narrow and delimited by leaf veins or irregularly or elliptically shaped2.", "Necrotic lesions on leaves and stems that develop after infected cells collapse2."]
["Black or brown fruiting structures (pycnidia or pseudothecia) that develop in the substomatal cavities of the host and are spaced regularly within the lesions2.", "Pycnidiospores or ascospores that are released from the pycnidia or pseudothecia and can be observed under a microscope2."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of wheat Septoria blotch, Mycosphaerella graminicola (asexual stage: Septoria tritici), has developed resistance to several fungicides, such as quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs), and demethylation inhibitors (DMIs)1. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the target genes of the fungicides, such as cytochrome b, succinate dehydrogenase subunits, and sterol 14ГЋВ±-demethylase1. The level of resistance varies depending on the fungicide group and the geographic region1. A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of wheat Septoria blotch is based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)2. This method can detect the presence of M. graminicola DNA in wheat leaf samples within 30 minutes using a portable device2. The LAMP method is more sensitive, specific, and rapid than conventional PCR-based methods2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of wheat Septoria blotch involves the secretion of effectors by M. graminicola that modulate the host defense response and facilitate fungal colonization3. Some of the effectors identified are necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins (NLPs), cerato-platanin proteins (CPPs), and secreted lipases (SLs)3. 
The type and number of effectors vary depending on the fungal isolate and the host genotype3. The infestation of different plants by M. graminicola also depends on the host susceptibility and resistance genes3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of wheat Septoria blotch are not well known, as most studies have focused on the fungal pathogen. However, some studies have suggested that bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas translucens may interact with M. graminicola and affect its virulence. One possible target gene for bacterial pathogens is Stb6, which confers resistance to M. graminicola in wheat. Knocking out this gene may increase the susceptibility of wheat to both fungal and bacterial infections.
