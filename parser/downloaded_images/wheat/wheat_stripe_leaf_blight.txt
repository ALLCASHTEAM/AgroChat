Wheat is a type of cereal crop that can be classified as a staple crop because it is widely consumed as a staple food by humans and livestock1. Wheat streak leaf blight is a type of bacterial disease that is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae2 3 4 5.
The pathogenic bacterium of wheat streak leaf blight does not produce spores, but rather multiplies and spreads through water droplets on the leaf surface2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of wheat streak leaf blight are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind. The disease is more prevalent in cool and wet conditions, especially during the late vegetative and early reproductive stages of wheat growth. The bacterium can be transmitted by rain splash, winddriven rain, or irrigation water from infected to healthy plants. The bacterium can also be seed-borne or survive on crop residues or grassy weeds2 3 4 5.
The period of disease onset for wheat streak leaf blight varies depending on the source and timing of inoculum, but it can occur as early as the tillering stage or as late as the heading stage of wheat development. The disease symptoms usually appear within 7 to 10 days after infection2 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool temperatures (15-25В°C) and high humidity (greater than 90%) for at least 6 hours. The disease is favored by frequent rainfall or overhead irrigation that creates prolonged periods of leaf wetness2 3 4 5.
The overwintering method of wheat streak leaf blight is mainly through infected seeds or crop residues that harbor the bacterium. The bacterium can also overwinter on grassy weeds such as foxtail, wild oat, or brome grass that serve as alternative hosts2 3 4.
There is no effective chemical control for this disease, as fungicides and antibiotics have shown little or no effect on reducing the bacterial pathogen1 2 3.
Removing infected plant parts may help to reduce the inoculum source, but it is not practical or feasible on a large scale1.
There is no known biological control agent for this disease.
The main agricultural control methods are planting resistant varieties, using clean seeds, rotating with non-host crops, and controlling grassy weeds that can harbor the bacterium4 1 5 2 3.

Yellowing and browning of the leaf tissue as the streaks become necrotic and reduce the photosynthetic capacity of the plant4 1 5 2 3.", "Stunting and reduced tillering of the infected plants due to impaired growth and development4 5."]
["Bacterial ooze that forms within the lesions and dries on the leaf surface, giving a shiny appearance to the streaks4 1 5 2 3. Bacterial streaming that can be observed under a microscope by placing a small piece of infected leaf tissue in water and examining it for bacterial cells that stream out of the tissue1."]
Mechanism of resistance: The bacterium can overcome host resistance by producing effector proteins that suppress plant defense responses or manipulate plant physiology1 2. The bacterium can also adapt to different environmental conditions by regulating gene expression through a complex network of transcription factors1. Type of resistance agent: The bacterium can be resistant to antibiotics, such as streptomycin, rifampicin, and tetracycline, due to the presence of plasmids or mutations that confer resistance1. Level of resistance: The level of resistance varies depending on the strain of the bacterium, the type and concentration of the antibiotic, and the environmental factors that affect bacterial growth and survival1. 
One possible quick test method is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that can detect the bacterium based on its specific DNA sequence in less than an hour. The LAMP assay can be performed using a simple device that provides constant temperature and visual detection of the amplified DNA3. 
The bacterium infects the plant by entering through natural openings (stomata) or wounds on the leaf surface. The bacterium then colonizes the intercellular spaces of the leaf tissue and produces extracellular polysaccharides that help it adhere to the plant cells and protect it from plant defenses. The bacterium also secretes effector proteins that modulate plant signaling pathways and interfere with plant immunity. Some effectors can also induce cell death or chlorosis in the plant tissue, resulting in disease symptoms1 2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the strain of the bacterium and the host plant species. Some effectors are conserved among different strains and hosts, while others are specific to certain combinations. For example, one effector called XopJ4 is only present in strains that infect wheat and barley, and another effector called XopAI is only recognized by wheat plants that carry a resistance gene called Xa12. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility between the bacterium and the host plant. Some plants have innate or acquired resistance to the bacterium, while others are susceptible or tolerant. The interaction between the bacterium and the plant is influenced by several factors, such as genetic diversity, environmental conditions, plant developmental stage, and co-infection with other pathogens1 2. 
One possible approach to identify potential targets of the bacterium is to use a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that can reveal genes or loci that are associated with resistance or susceptibility to the disease. For example, a GWAS conducted on wheat revealed several candidate genes that may be involved in bacterial leaf streak resistance, such as genes encoding receptor-like kinases, transcription factors, defense-related proteins, and cell wall components4. Another possible approach is to use a reverse genetics method that can test the function of specific genes by knocking them out or overexpressing them in the plant. For example, a reverse genetics study showed that knocking out a gene called Os11N3 in rice increased its susceptibility to bacterial leaf streak, suggesting that this gene plays a role in defense against the bacterium.
