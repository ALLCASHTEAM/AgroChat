Wheat is a staple crop that provides food for humans and animals1 2. Wheat mosaic disease can be caused by different types of viruses, such as Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV) or Soilborne Wheat Mosaic Virus (SBWMV)3 1 4 2 5.
The pathogenic viruses of wheat mosaic disease are transmitted by a soilborne fungus called Polymyxa graminis or by a mite called Aceria tosichella3 1 4 5. These vectors do not reproduce sexually, but rather by asexual spores or eggs, respectively4 5. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of wheat mosaic disease depend on the virus and the vector involved. WSMV is transmitted by the wheat curl mite, which can spread by wind from infected plants to healthy ones6 5. SBWMV is transmitted by Polymyxa graminis, which can persist in the soil for many years and infect the roots of susceptible plants4. Both viruses can also be transmitted by seed, but this is less common1 4.
The period of disease onset for wheat mosaic disease varies depending on the virus, the vector, and the environmental conditions. WSMV can infect plants in the fall or spring, but symptoms usually appear in the spring as temperatures warm up1. SBWMV can only infect plants in the fall, but symptoms also appear in the spring when plants resume growth4. The environmental conditions required for the disease depend on the virus and the vector involved. WSMV is favored by warm and dry conditions that favor the survival and dispersal of the wheat curl mite1. SBWMV is favored by cool and moist conditions that favor the survival and infection of Polymyxa graminis4. Both viruses cause more severe symptoms when plants are infected at an early stage of development1 4.
The overwintering method of wheat mosaic disease depends on the virus and the vector involved. WSMV can overwinter in living plants, such as wheat, corn, and other grasses, that serve as hosts for both the virus and the mite1. SBWMV can overwinter in the soil as spores of Polymyxa graminis or in infected plant debris4.
There is no effective chemical control for wheat mosaic disease once the plants are infected. However, some fungicides can reduce the population of the vector, wheat curl mite, which transmits the virus. For example, imidacloprid seed treatment can reduce mite infestation and virus transmission1.
There are no physical measures that can effectively control this disease. Cutting off infected parts may not eliminate the virus or the mite from the plant.
There are no known biological agents that can control this disease. However, some natural enemies of the wheat curl mite, such as predatory mites and lady beetles, may help reduce its population and spread1.
The most effective and economical way to control this disease is to use resistant varieties of wheat and to eliminate volunteer wheat and other grassy weeds that serve as alternative hosts for the virus and the mite. Planting date is also important, as early planting increases the risk of infection from nearby maturing crops or weeds. Crop rotation with non-host crops can also help break the disease cycle1 2.

They are white to yellow in color and have two pairs of legs at the front end of their elongated body1.", "Presence of wheat streak mosaic virus particles in plant tissues, which can be detected by laboratory tests such as ELISA or PCR1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic viruses of wheat mosaic disease is conferred by different genes in wheat, such as Ym1 and Ym2 for Wheat Yellow Mosaic Virus (WYMV), and Sbwm1 and Sbwm2 for Soilborne Wheat Mosaic Virus (SBWMV)1 2 3 4. The mechanism of resistance involves either hindering the initial movement of the virus from the vector into the root or suppressing viral multiplication2. The type of resistance agent is a CC-NBS-LRR protein that belongs to the plant immune system2. The level of resistance depends on the virus strain, the wheat variety, and the environmental conditions3 4. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic viruses of wheat mosaic disease is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that can detect the presence of viral RNA in plant samples5. This method requires extracting RNA from plant tissues, reverse transcribing it into cDNA, and amplifying it using specific primers for the target virus5. The PCR products can then be visualized by gel electrophoresis or other methods5. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of wheat mosaic disease involves the interaction of the virus and its vector with the host plant. WYMV and SBWMV are transmitted by different vectors: a mite called Aceria tosichella for WYMV, and a soilborne fungus called Polymyxa graminis for SBWMV1 3 4 5. These vectors can infect the roots of susceptible plants and deliver the virus into the plant cells1 3 4 5. The virus then replicates and moves through the vascular system to reach the leaves, where it causes symptoms such as mosaic, streaks, mottling, and stunting1 3 4 5. The type and number of pathogenic effectors of the virus are not well known, but they may include proteins that suppress plant defense responses or facilitate viral replication and movement. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on their genetic resistance or susceptibility to the virus and its vector2 3 4.
