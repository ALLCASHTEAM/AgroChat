Lablab purpureus is a legume crop that can be used as a pulse crop, a green vegetable, a forage crop, a cover crop, a green manure, a wildlife attractant and an ornamental crop1 2. It can be classified as a horticultural crop because it is grown for human consumption and ornamental purposes3. Lablab purpureus brown spot disease is caused by a bacterial pathogen called Pseudomonas syringae4. It is also known as bacterial blight5.
The mode of reproduction of Pseudomonas syringae is binary fission, which means it divides into two identical cells. It does not produce spores or conidia. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of bacterial blight are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and wind. The bacteria can enter the plant through natural openings or wounds, and can be spread by rain splash, irrigation water, insects, infected seeds or contaminated tools6 .
The period of disease onset for bacterial blight depends on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the host plant. The disease can develop rapidly under warm and humid conditions, and can cause severe losses in yield and quality. The first symptoms to appear are small, angular, pale green, water-soaked spots on the leaves, which gradually enlarge and merge to form large brown blotches with dry centers5. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30В°C), high humidity (above 90%) and frequent rainfall or overhead irrigation. The disease is more severe on young and succulent tissues, and on plants that are stressed by nutrient deficiency or insect damage5.
The overwintering method of this disease is not well documented, but it is possible that the bacteria can survive on infected seeds, plant debris, weeds or alternative hosts. Some strains of Pseudomonas syringae can also produce ice nucleation proteins that allow them to induce frost injury and colonize frost-damaged tissues.
Applying fungicides such as carbendazim, mancozeb or thiophanate-methyl can reduce the disease incidence and severity1 2. The application dose, period and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease situation.
Removing and destroying the infected plant parts or plant debris can prevent the spread of the bacteria3. Soaking the seeds in hot water (50В°C for 30 minutes) can also reduce the seed-borne infection1.
Using antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens or Trichoderma harzianum can inhibit the growth and activity of Pseudomonas syringae1 2. These biocontrol agents can be applied as seed treatments or foliar sprays.
Practicing crop rotation, intercropping, weed management, balanced fertilization, irrigation management and resistant cultivars can enhance the plant health and resistance to bacterial blight3 4.

["Bacterial ooze that may be visible on the leaf surface or under a microscope", "Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that can be isolated from the infected tissues and cultured on a selective medium", "Positive reactions to biochemical tests such as oxidase, catalase, levan production and ice nucleation3 2"]
Producing antimicrobial compounds that can inhibit the growth or activity of Pseudomonas syringae1 2. Inducing systemic acquired resistance (SAR) or induced systemic resistance (ISR) in the plant, which can enhance the defense responses against bacterial infection2. Modulating the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway, which can regulate the expression of genes involved in plant immunity2. 
Collecting leaf samples with brown spot symptoms and cutting them into small pieces Placing the leaf pieces in a sterile tube with distilled water and shaking them vigorously Plating the leaf extract on a King's B medium and incubating at 28В°C for 24-48 hours Observing the colony morphology and color of the bacteria on the medium Confirming the identity of the bacteria by performing biochemical tests such as oxidase, catalase, levan production and ice nucleation3 4 
Entering the plant through natural openings or wounds on the leaf surface Multiplying and colonizing in the intercellular spaces of the leaf mesophyll Producing virulence factors such as toxins, enzymes, siderophores and effectors that can damage the plant cells or interfere with the plant defense responses Injecting type III effectors into the plant cytoplasm through a specialized secretion system called type III secretion system (T3SS) Manipulating the plant signaling pathways, gene expression and metabolism to favor bacterial growth and survival3 4 
Genes involved in JA biosynthesis or signaling, such as LOX2, JAR1, COI1 and JAZ2 Genes involved in SAR or ISR, such as NPR1, PR1 and EDS12 Genes involved in plant cell wall synthesis or degradation, such as PME, PGIP and XTH4 Genes involved in plant hormone synthesis or signaling, such as ABA, SA and ET4 Knockout lethal genes are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of an organism. Knocking out these genes would result in death or severe defects. I do not have information on knockout lethal genes for Pseudomonas syringae.
