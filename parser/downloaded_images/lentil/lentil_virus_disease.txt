Lentil (Lens culinaris) is a pulse crop that belongs to the family Fabaceae1. Lentil virus disease is caused by various viruses that belong to different families, such as Alfamovirus, Luteovirus, Potyvirus, etc1.
The pathogenic viruses of lentil virus disease are not fungi, so they do not have a mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus. Viruses replicate by using the host cell machinery and genetic material2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of lentil virus disease depend on the type of virus and the environmental conditions. Some viruses are transmitted by aphids in a persistent or nonpersistent manner, such as bean leaf roll virus (BLRV), beet western yellows virus (BWYV), alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), etc1. Some viruses are mechanically sap-transmissible, such as AMV3. Some viruses are seed-transmitted, such as AMV and BLRV3 4.
The period of disease onset for lentil virus disease varies depending on the type of virus and the stage of plant growth. Some viruses cause symptoms early in the season, such as AMV and BLRV3 4. Some viruses cause symptoms later in the season, such as bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)1. The environmental conditions required for the disease depend on the type of virus and the vector population. Generally, warm and humid conditions favor aphid activity and virus transmission1. Some viruses, such as AMV and BYMV, can also infect lentil plants under cool temperatures3 1.
The overwintering method of lentil virus disease depends on the type of virus and the availability of alternative hosts. Some viruses can overwinter in perennial weeds or crops that serve as reservoirs, such as BLRV, BWYV, CMV, etc1. Some viruses can overwinter in seeds or plant debris, such as AMV and BLRV3 4.
Insecticides can be used to reduce the population of aphid vectors that transmit some viruses, such as BLRV, BWYV, AMV, etc1 2. However, insecticides are not very effective against non-persistent viruses, such as AMV and BYMV3. The type of insecticide, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect depend on the local conditions and regulations.
Rogueing and destroying infected plants can help to reduce the spread of some viruses, such as AMV and BLRV3 . However, this method is not feasible for large-scale production or when infection is widespread.
There are no known biological agents that can control lentil virus disease effectively.
Cultural practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, weed control, use of certified seeds, and planting resistant or tolerant varieties can help to prevent or reduce the impact of lentil virus disease1 2 3 . For example, planting lentils with barley can reduce the incidence of BLRV and BWYV by interfering with aphid movement2. Some varieties of lentils have resistance or tolerance to some viruses, such as AMV, BLRV, BWYV, CMV, etc3 .
["Chlorosis: Yellowing of leaves or veins caused by some viruses, such as AMV, BLRV, BWYV, CMV, etc1 2 3 . Mosaic or mottling: Irregular patterns of green and yellow on leaves caused by some viruses, such as AMV, BYMV, CMV, etc1 3 . Stunting: Reduced plant growth caused by some viruses, such as AMV, BLRV, BWYV, BYMV, CMV, etc1 2 3 . Leaf rolling or curling: Upward or downward bending of leaf margins caused by some viruses, such as BLRV and BYMV2 3. Necrosis: Browning or dying of leaf tissue caused by some viruses, such as AMV and BYMV1 3.", "Reddening: Purple or red coloration of leaves or stems caused by some viruses, such as BLRV and BWYV2 .", "Malformation: Abnormal shape or size of leaves or flowers caused by some viruses, such as AMV and BYMV1 3.", "Reduced flowering and pod formation: Decreased number or size of flowers or pods caused by some viruses, such as AMV, BLRV, BWYV, BYMV, CMV etc1 2 3 .", "Small and shriveled seeds: Reduced quality or quantity of seeds caused by some viruses, such as AMV and BYMV1 3."]
["Presence of aphids: Aphids are small insects that suck plant sap and transmit some viruses. They can be seen on the leaves or stems of infected plants1. Presence of viral particles: Viral particles are microscopic structures that contain the genetic material and proteins of the virus. They can be detected by electron microscopy or serological tests3.", "Presence of viral inclusions: Viral inclusions are aggregates of viral proteins that form within the cytoplasm or nucleus of infected cells. They can be observed by light microscopy after staining with specific dyes3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is not relevant, because lentil virus disease is caused by viruses, not bacteria. Viruses are not living organisms and do not have the same mechanisms of resistance as bacteria. However, some viruses may have genetic variations that allow them to escape the host immune system or the effects of antiviral drugs1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic viruses of the disease is to use serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunocapture reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR). These tests can detect the presence of viral antigens or nucleic acids in plant samples2 3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease depends on the type of virus and the host plant. Generally, viruses enter plant cells through wounds or natural openings, such as stomata or plasmodesmata. They then use the host cell machinery and genetic material to replicate and produce viral proteins. Some viruses may also encode pathogenic effectors, such as suppressors of RNA silencing or movement proteins, that interfere with the host defense system or facilitate viral spread within and between plants1 . The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary among different viruses and may also affect the susceptibility or resistance of different plants. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic viruses of the disease are not well known, because there are many factors that influence the interaction between viruses and plants. However, some possible targets include genes involved in plant immunity, such as resistance genes (R genes) or pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), genes involved in plant development, such as transcription factors or hormone signaling pathways, and genes involved in plant metabolism, such as photosynthesis or stress response genes. Knockout or silencing of these genes may alter the outcome of viral infection in plants.
