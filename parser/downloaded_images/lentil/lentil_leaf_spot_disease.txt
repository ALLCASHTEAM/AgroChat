Lentil is a pulse crop that belongs to the legume family1. Lentil spot disease is a common name for ascochyta blight, which is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Ascochyta lentis1.
The pathogenic fungus of lentil spot disease reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by rain splash or wind1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of lentil spot disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop density. The disease is mainly airborne and can spread from infected seeds, debris, or volunteer plants2.
The period of disease onset for lentil spot disease varies depending on the crop stage and the weather conditions. The disease can infect plants at any growth stage, but it is more severe during the flowering and podding stages. The disease can develop rapidly when the temperature is between 15В°C and 25В°C and the relative humidity is above 90%1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are similar to those that favor the growth of lentil plants. The disease thrives in cool and moist conditions, and can be reduced by hot and dry weather. The disease also prefers alkaline soils with high organic matter content1.
The overwintering method of lentil spot disease is through survival structures called pseudothecia, which are sexual fruiting bodies that form on infected plant residues. These structures can release ascospores, which are sexual spores that can initiate new infections in the next season1.
Apply a registered fungicide at the first sign of disease or when conditions are favorable for infection. A single application may be enough, but repeat applications may be needed if the weather remains wet. Follow the label instructions for the type, dose, and timing of the fungicide.
Remove and destroy all infected plant parts and crop residues after harvest to reduce the source of inoculum for the next season. Avoid overhead irrigation and adjust row spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
There are no known biological agents that can effectively control lentil spot disease.
Plant only disease-free or fungicide-treated seeds. Rotate crops with non-host plants such as cereals or oilseeds for at least three years. Plant resistant or tolerant varieties of lentil if available.
["The disease symptoms of lentil spot disease are spot-like lesions that appear on all above-ground parts of the plant, including leaves, stems, pods, and seeds1 2 3. The lesions are initially light gray, but become tan with a dark brown margin. The centers of the lesions become speckled with tiny black dots, which are the fruiting bodies of the fungus. The lesions can coalesce and cause defoliation, pod abortion, seed discoloration, and reduced yield and quality."]
["The disease signs of lentil spot disease are the presence of the fungal structures on the infected plant tissues1 2 3. These include:", "Pycnidia: Small, black, flask-shaped structures that produce conidia (asexual spores). They are visible as black specks in the center of the lesions.", "Conidia: Elliptical, hyaline, unicellular spores that are dispersed by rain splash or wind. They are microscopic and require a microscope to be seen.", "Pseudothecia: Spherical, black, cup-like structures that produce ascospores (sexual spores). They are formed on infected plant residues and can survive over winter. They are visible as black dots on the crop debris.", "Ascospores: Oval, hyaline, unicellular spores that are released from pseudothecia and can initiate new infections in the next season. They are microscopic and require a microscope to be seen."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of lentil spot disease is not well studied, but some reports suggest that the pathogen can develop resistance to certain fungicides, such as benzimidazoles and strobilurins1. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the target site of the fungicide, such as the beta-tubulin gene or the cytochrome b gene1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the pathogen population and the fungicide dose and frequency1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of lentil spot disease is based on molecular detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)2. These methods can identify the pathogen DNA from infected plant tissues or seeds within a few hours. The methods require specific primers that can amplify a region of the pathogen genome that is unique and conserved2. 
Necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins (NEP1Ls): Small secreted proteins that can induce cell death and ethylene production in plant cells, leading to tissue necrosis and disease development3. Glucanase inhibitor proteins (GIPs): Proteins that can inhibit plant glucanases, which are enzymes that degrade fungal cell walls and act as defense responses3. Cutinases: Enzymes that can degrade plant cuticle, which is a protective layer on the plant surface that prevents water loss and pathogen entry3. Pectinases: Enzymes that can degrade plant cell wall components, such as pectin, which are important for cell adhesion and integrity3. LysM effectors: Proteins that can bind to chitin and chitosan, which are fungal cell wall components that can trigger plant immunity3. Small cysteine-rich proteins (SCRPs): Proteins that may have diverse functions in modulating plant responses, such as suppressing plant immunity, altering plant hormone signaling, or manipulating plant metabolism3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of lentil spot disease are not well known, but some studies have suggested some candidate genes that may be involved in plant resistance or susceptibility to the disease4. These include: Resistance (R) genes: Plant genes that encode proteins that can recognize specific pathogen effectors and trigger defense responses. Some R genes have been identified in lentil and its wild relatives that confer resistance to different races of lentil spot disease4. Susceptibility (S) genes: Plant genes that encode proteins that are required for pathogen infection or colonization. Some S genes have been identified in other legume crops that are targeted by lentil spot disease effectors, such as NEP1Ls or GIPs4.
