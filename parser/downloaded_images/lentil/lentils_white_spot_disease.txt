Type of crop: Lablab purpureus is a warm-season annual legume that originated from Africa. It is widely adapted to a variety of soils and climatic conditions throughout the country. However, it does not tolerate wet soil conditions1. It is grown as a food crop for the flowers, leaves, immature seeds and edible pods2 3 4 5. It can also be used as a forage crop for livestock or a cover crop for soil improvement1 4. Depending on the purpose and region, it can be classified as a cash crop, horticultural crop or staple crop4. Disease type: Leucoplakia is a fungal disease caused by Cercospora dolichi . It affects the leaves and pods of Lablab purpureus and causes white spots or patches on them . It can reduce the yield and quality of the crop.
Mode of reproduction: The pathogenic fungus Cercospora dolichi reproduces by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in structures called conidiophores . The conidia are dispersed by wind or rain and infect new host plants . Epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission: Leucoplakia is a polycyclic disease, which means that it can produce multiple cycles of infection within a growing season. The disease cycle begins when conidia land on the surface of the leaves or pods and germinate under favorable conditions of high humidity and moderate temperature .
The germinated conidia penetrate the plant tissue and form hyphae, which are filamentous structures that grow and feed on the host cells. The hyphae produce conidiophores that emerge through the stomata or wounds and produce new conidia. The new conidia can infect the same plant or be dispersed to other plants by wind or rain. The disease cycle can repeat as long as there are susceptible host plants and favorable environmental conditions . Environmental conditions required for the disease: Leucoplakia is favored by high humidity (&gt;90%) and moderate temperature (20-30В°C) . It is also influenced by the plant density, irrigation frequency, nitrogen fertilization and crop rotation .
Overwintering method: Leucoplakia can overwinter as conidia or mycelium on infected plant debris or seeds. The fungus can also survive on alternative hosts such as cowpea, soybean, peanut and other legumes .
Spraying with Bordeaux mixture (a mixture of copper sulfate and lime) can reduce the severity of leaf spot and powdery mildew caused by Cercospora dolichi and Leveillula taurica var. macrospora1. The type of agent, application dose, application period and number of applications depend on the local conditions and recommendations. The control effect may vary depending on the disease pressure and environmental factors.
Cutting off the infected parts of the plant can prevent the spread of the disease and reduce the inoculum source. However, this may also reduce the yield and quality of the crop.
Using native natural enemies of silverleaf whitefly (SLW), a vector of begomoviruses that can infect Lablab purpureus, can enhance the bio-control of SLW and increase the yield of the crop. For example, growing lablab alongside a pumpkin crop may attract predatory mites (Amblyseius swirskii), lacewings (Chrysoperla carnea) and ladybirds (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri) that can feed on SLW eggs and nymphs2.
Adopting good agronomic practices can reduce the susceptibility of the crop to leucoplakia and other diseases. For example, using disease-free seeds or seed treatment, rotating with non-host crops, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, irrigating at appropriate frequency and time, maintaining optimal plant density and spacing, removing plant debris after harvest, etc.
["Leucoplakia causes white spots or patches on the leaves and pods of Lablab purpureus. The spots are irregular in shape and size, and may coalesce to form large necrotic areas. The spots may also have a yellow halo around them. The infected leaves may curl, distort or drop prematurely. The infected pods may become shriveled, discolored or deformed."]
["Leucoplakia can be identified by the presence of the pathogen itself on the plant surface. The fungus Cercospora dolichi produces conidiophores that emerge through the stomata or wounds on the leaves or pods. The conidiophores are slender, branched and septate structures that bear conidia at their tips. The conidia are hyaline, cylindrical or oblong, single-celled or septate spores that are dispersed by wind or rain."]

A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of Lablab purpureus leucoplakia is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. This is a molecular technique that can detect specific DNA sequences of the bacteria in plant samples. The LAMP assay can be performed in a single tube within an hour, and the results can be visualized by color change or fluorescence1. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of Lablab purpureus leucoplakia is not clear, but it may involve the production of toxins or enzymes by the bacteria that cause necrosis and chlorosis of the plant tissues. The bacteria may also colonize the vascular system of the plant and interfere with water and nutrient transport1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors of the bacteria are unknown, but they may vary depending on the strain and host plant. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the susceptibility and resistance of the plant varieties, as well as the environmental factors that affect the bacterial growth and infection1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of Lablab purpureus leucoplakia are also unknown, but they may include genes that are involved in plant defense, stress response, or metabolism. Knockout lethal genes are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of an organism, and their disruption or deletion leads to death or severe defects. Identifying knockout lethal genes of the bacteria may help to develop novel strategies for disease control1.
