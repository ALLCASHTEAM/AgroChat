Melon is a horticultural crop that belongs to the cucurbit family1 2. Melon downy mildew is an oomycete disease caused by the pathogen Pseudoperonospora cubensis1 2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of melon downy mildew reproduces by producing sporangia, which are spore-bearing structures that can either germinate directly or release zoospores, which are motile spores that can swim in water and infect leaves1 2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of melon downy mildew are influenced by air currents, splashing water, and humid conditions. The pathogen does not overwinter in cold regions, but can be carried by wind from warmer regions where it survives on living plant tissue. It can also spread by water droplets or by contact with infected tools or hands4 2 5.
The period of disease onset for melon downy mildew depends on the environmental conditions and the presence of inoculum. In eastern states with similar conditions to Minnesota, downy mildew usually arrives at the end of the growing season, often in August. However, in some years it can arrive earlier in the season due to changes in the pathogen's biology or greenhouse production of cucurbits1. Symptoms usually appear 5 to 7 days after infection3. The environmental conditions required for melon downy mildew are wet or very humid conditions and a temperature range of 41-86В°F (5-30В°C), with optimal temperatures of 59-68В°F (15-20В°C). The pathogen also needs moisture on the leaf surface to germinate and infect1 2 5 3.
The overwintering method of melon downy mildew is to survive on living plant tissue in warmer regions where cucurb
Fungicides can be applied to prevent or reduce the disease, but they are not very effective for home gardeners. Commercial growers can use mobile fungicides with active ingredients that target the pathogen, such as cyazofamid, dimethomorph, mandipropamid, or mefenoxam1 2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect can vary depending on the environmental conditions and the pathogen strain3.
Infected plants or plant parts can be removed and destroyed to reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease1 4.
There are no known biological agents that can effectively control melon downy mildew1.
Cultural practices such as using drip irrigation, wide row spacing, trellising, and avoiding overhead irrigation can help reduce the leaf wetness and humidity that favor the disease development. Planting resistant varieties or using certified disease-free seeds can also help prevent the disease1 4 2 3.
["Yellow to pale green spots on the upper side of the leaves that are restricted by leaf veins. The spots later turn brown and necrotic1 4 2 .", "Dark purplish-grey fuzz on the underside of the leaves in high humidity. This is the sporulation of the pathogen1 4 2 .", "Rapid defoliation of the plants when the disease is severe. The leaves appear as if frost had killed them1 4 2 .", "Exaggerated upward leaf curling on watermelons1 4."]
["Sporangia, which are spore-bearing structures that can be seen with a 20X hand lens on the underside of the leaves. They are darkly colored and angular in shape4 2.", "Zoospores, which are motile spores that can swim in water and infect leaves. They are released from sporangia in wet conditions and are microscopic in size4 2."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of melon downy mildew is Pseudoperonospora cubensis, which is an oomycete pathogen1. It has different races that can infect different cucurbit hosts, such as cucumbers, melons, pumpkins and squash2. The mechanism of resistance of this pathogen is mainly based on genetic variation and adaptation to different environmental conditions and host genotypes. The type of resistance agent that can be used against this pathogen is fungicide, which can be applied preventively or curatively2 3. The level of resistance of this pathogen depends on the race, the host, the fungicide and the environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and air currents2 3 . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of melon downy mildew is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect the DNA of the pathogen from infected plant samples. This method can be used to identify the race of the pathogen and monitor its distribution and evolution. Another quick test method is immunofluorescence microscopy, which can visualize the spores of the pathogen using fluorescent antibodies. This method can be used to confirm the presence of the pathogen and differentiate it from other similar pathogens. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of melon downy mildew is based on the infection cycle of the pathogen, which involves several stages: The spores of the pathogen (sporangia) are dispersed by wind or water and land on the surface of a susceptible host plant. The sporangia germinate either directly or by releasing motile zoospores that swim towards the stomata (pores) of the plant. The zoospores enter the stomata and form a structure called a haustorium, which penetrates the plant cells and extracts nutrients from them. The haustorium develops into a mycelium, which grows intercellularly within the plant tissue and produces new sporangia on the underside of the leaves. The new sporangia are released and start a new cycle of infection. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors of melon downy mildew are not well known, but some studies have identified some candidate genes that may be involved in modulating host immunity and susceptibility. These genes encode proteins that are secreted by the pathogen into the plant cells and interact with plant receptors or regulators. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility between the host genotype and the pathogen race, as well as other factors such as plant age, growth stage, cultivar, resistance genes and environmental conditions2 .
