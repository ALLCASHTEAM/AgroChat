Melon is a type of horticultural crop, which means it is grown for its edible fruits1. Melon powdery mildew is a type of fungal disease, caused by two different fungi: Podosphaera xanthii and Golovinomyces cichoracearum2.
The pathogenic fungus of melon powdery mildew reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that can be dispersed by wind or insects1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of melon powdery mildew are influenced by several factors, such as the presence of susceptible hosts, environmental conditions, and fungicide resistance. The disease can be transmitted by airborne conidia that land on the plant surface and germinate under favorable conditions, or by insectborne conidia that are carried by aphids or other sucking insects1 3.
The period of disease onset for melon powdery mildew varies depending on the region and the crop. In general, the disease can appear at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common in mid to late summer when the weather is warm and dry3 . The environmental conditions required for the disease are high relative humidity (above 80%), low leaf wetness (less than 6 hours per day), and moderate temperatures (between 20В°C and 30В°C). These conditions favor the germination of conidia and the infection of plant tissues1 3.
The overwintering method of this disease depends on the pathogen species and the region. Podosphaera xanthii can overwinter as mycelium or chasmothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) on crop debris or weeds, while Golovinomyces cichoracearum can overwinter as chasmothecia on perennial hosts such as dandelion or chicory1 2.
Applying fungicides weekly with protectant fungicides and alternating among available chemistry based on FRAC (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee) code to prevent resistance development. Some examples of targeted fungicides are sulfur, potassium bicarbonate, myclobutanil, triflumizole, and azoxystrobin1. The application dose, period, number of applications, and control effect depend on the product label and the disease severity.
Removing infected leaves and stems and destroying them to reduce inoculum. Pruning or trellising plants to improve air circulation and sunlight exposure2 1.
Using beneficial microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis or Ampelomyces quisqualis that can antagonize or parasitize the powdery mildew fungus1.
Planting resistant varieties when available, or avoiding the most susceptible varieties. Planting in full sun and spacing plants well apart. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization that can stimulate succulent growth2 1.
["Small, circular, yellow lesions on leaves and petioles that may coalesce and cause chlorosis1.", "White, powdery spots that may form on both surfaces of leaves, on shoots, and sometimes on flowers and fruit. These spots gradually spread over a large area of the leaves and stems2.", "Premature senescence of infected leaves that may result in reduced market quality because fruit become sunburnt or ripen prematurely or incompletely1.", "Stress from disease that can lead to imperfections on fruit rind such as speckling, raised indentations, and oedema1."]
["The presence of white, powdery spores that make up the bulk of the fungal growth visible on the plantвЂ™s  surface. These spores are produced in chains that can be seen with a hand lens2.", "The presence of chasmothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) that appear as small, dark specks within the white fungal growth. These structures can overwinter on crop debris or weeds and release ascospores in spring1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is: The mechanism of resistance is based on the genetic variation of the fungus, which can produce different races or strains that can overcome the host resistance genes1 2. The type of resistance agent is the host resistance gene, which can be dominant or recessive, qualitative or quantitative, and confer race-specific or broad-spectrum resistance1 2 3. The level of resistance depends on the interaction between the host resistance gene and the fungal race or strain. There are at least four races (1, 2, S, and N) of Podosphaera xanthii and two races (1 and 2) of Golovinomyces cichoracearum that have been reported to infect melon1 4. Most commercial melon varieties have resistance to races 1 and 2 of both fungi, but not to race S or N of Podosphaera xanthii4. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is: Using molecular markers such as PCR-based or KASP-based markers that can detect specific DNA sequences of the fungus or the host resistance gene2 3. Using a detached leaf assay that can evaluate the susceptibility or resistance of melon leaves to different fungal races or strains under controlled conditions2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is: The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown for melon powdery mildew fungi, but they are likely to be secreted proteins that can manipulate the host defense response or metabolism2. The differences in infestation of different plants are determined by the compatibility or incompatibility between the fungal race or strain and the host resistance gene. If the fungus can overcome the host resistance gene, it can successfully infect and colonize the plant tissue. If the host resistance gene can recognize the fungal race or strain, it can trigger a hypersensitive reaction that limits the fungal growth2. 
Melon powdery mildew is caused by the fungus genus Erysiphe cichoracearum. This powdery mildew fungus grows on the plant surface and infests the tissues of the host plant through mycelium. Regulatory pathways and signaling pathways associated with mycelium formation, growth and invasion may be potential targets. Melon powdery mildew is caused by a fungal pathogen, not a bacterial one.
