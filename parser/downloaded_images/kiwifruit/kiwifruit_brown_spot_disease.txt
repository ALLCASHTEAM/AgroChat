Kiwifruit is a horticultural crop that is native to China and widely cultivated in temperate regions1. Kiwifruit brown spot disease is a fungal disease that can be caused by different species of fungi, such as Phoma sp.2, Fusarium fujikuroi3, Fusarium graminearum4, and Colletotrichum cassiicola5.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungi of this disease varies depending on the species. For example, Phoma sp. produces pycnidia that contain conidia2, Fusarium fujikuroi produces microconidia and macroconidia3, and Colletotrichum cassiicola produces acervuli that contain setae and conidia5. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease also depend on the species of fungi. Generally, the fungi can infect the leaves through wounds or natural openings, and can be spread by rain splash, wind, insects, or contaminated tools6. Some fungi can also infect the fruits and cause fruit rot1.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually during the growing season, especially when the weather is warm and humid1. Some fungi can also cause post-harvest decay of fruits during storage or transportation1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are mainly high temperature and high humidity, which favor the germination and infection of the fungal spores1. Some fungi can also survive in low temperature and low humidity conditions, such as Fusarium fujikuroi3.
The overwintering method of this disease is mainly through the survival of the fungal spores or mycelia on the infected plant debris or in the soil1. Some fungi can also overwinter on alternative hosts or weeds, such as Fusarium graminearum4.
Applying fungicides such as tetramycin1 2 3 or honokiol2 4 at the recommended doses and intervals, especially before or after rainy periods or during flowering and fruiting stages5 1 2.
Pruning and removing the infected leaves, fruits, and branches, and burning or burying them to prevent further spread of the disease5.
Using antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis or Trichoderma harzianum to inhibit the growth and infection of the pathogenic fungi5.
Planting resistant cultivars, improving soil drainage and aeration, avoiding excessive irrigation and fertilization, enhancing plant immunity, and rotating crops with non-host plants5.
["Small, dark brown leaf spots that enlarge irregularly and develop into brown necrotic spots with dying curly edges6 1 2 4.", "Premature defoliation and fruit drop that reduce fruit yield and quality5 2.", "Soft and shriveled fruits with gray mold that appear mostly at the stem end5."]
["The presence of fungal structures such as pycnidia, conidia, acervuli, setae, microconidia, or macroconidia on the infected leaves or fruits, which can be observed under a microscope or with a magnifying glass6 1 2 4.", "The isolation and identification of the causal agent by morphological and molecular characteristics using specific media, primers, and sequences6 1 2 4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungi of the disease is not well studied, but some studies have reported that some fungi can develop resistance to certain fungicides, such as benzimidazoles or dicarboximides1. The mechanism of resistance may involve the alteration of the target site, the increased expression of efflux pumps, or the modification of cell wall permeability1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal strain, the fungicide dose, and the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungi of the disease is not available, but some methods have been proposed to detect and identify the causal agents, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)2 3 4 5, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)5, or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)5. These methods require specific primers, probes, or databases to amplify or analyze the fungal DNA or proteins2 3 4 5. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but some studies have suggested that some fungi can produce toxins or enzymes that can degrade the plant cell wall or interfere with the plant defense system1 4. For example, Fusarium fujikuroi can produce fumonisins, gibberellins, and polygalacturonases that can cause necrosis, hyperelongation, and maceration of plant tissues4. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may differ among fungal species or strains1 4. The infestation of different plants may also depend on the host specificity, susceptibility, or resistance of the plants1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungi of the disease are not well known, but some studies have identified some genes that are essential for fungal growth, development, or pathogenicity, such as FUM1, GIB1, or PG1 in Fusarium fujikuroi4. These genes could be knocked out or silenced to reduce or eliminate the fungal virulence4.
