Kiwifruit is a horticultural crop that is native to southwestern China and northeastern Asia1 2. Kiwifruit gray spot disease is a fungal disease caused by Botrytis cinerea, also known as gray mold1 3.
The pathogenic fungus of kiwifruit gray spot disease reproduces by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in large numbers and dispersed by wind or water3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of kiwifruit gray spot disease are influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and canopy density. The fungus infects petals and anthers during bloom, and then remains latent until fruit mature and are harvested. The fungus can also infect fruit through picking wounds or stem ends4.
The period of disease onset for kiwifruit gray spot disease varies depending on the cultivar, the storage conditions, and the inoculum level. Generally, gray mold is not seen in the field, but appears after 4 to 8 weeks in cold storage3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm, moist, and low-light conditions that favor fungal growth and sporulation. The optimal temperature for infection is between 57В°F and 77В°F, and the minimum wetness duration is 6 hours3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by sclerotia, which are hardened masses of fungal tissue that can survive in soil or plant debris. Sclerotia can germinate and produce conidia under favorable conditions3.
Fungicides such as Flint Extra, Kenja 400 SC, Luna Tranquility, Miravis Prime, Ph-D WDG, Scala SC, and Vangard 75 WG can be applied during bloom when rainy weather is forecasted or during the pre-harvest period to prevent or reduce infection by Botrytis cinerea1. Postharvest applications of fungicides such as Scholar 230 SC and Fludioxonil can also be effective.
Pruning affected branches and removing infected fruit can help reduce the inoculum level and prevent the spread of the disease2 1.
Antagonistic yeasts such as Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Meyerozyma caribbica, and Candida oleophila can inhibit the growth of Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum (the causal agent of blue mold) on kiwifruit by competing for nutrients and space, forming biofilms, inducing host resistance, and producing volatile organic compounds (VOCs)3 .
Creating more open canopies by summer pruning, avoiding injury to the vines, maintaining proper moisture management, and holding kiwifruit at 59В°F for 2 days before cold storage can help prevent or minimize the disease2 1.

Mutation or overexpression of target genes that confer reduced sensitivity to fungicides, such as the osmosensing histidine kinase gene (BcOS1) and the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene (BcatrB) in Botrytis cinerea. Detoxification or efflux of fungicides by enzymes or transporters, such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases, and ATP-binding cassette transporters in Botrytis cinerea. Adaptation to environmental stress by altering the cell wall composition, membrane fluidity, or metabolic pathways, such as the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in Botrytis cinerea. Horizontal gene transfer of resistance genes from other fungi or bacteria, such as the transposable element Boty that carries a gene encoding resistance to methyl benzimidazole carbamates in Botrytis cinerea. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can amplify and detect specific DNA sequences of Botrytis cinerea from infected plant tissues. PCR can be combined with other techniques, such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), or real-time PCR, to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the detection. 
Polygalacturonases (PGs), which hydrolyze pectin, a major component of the plant cell wall. Botrytis cinerea produces at least 10 different PGs that have different substrate specificities and expression patterns. Cutinases, which degrade cutin, a protective layer on the plant epidermis. Botrytis cinerea produces two cutinases, BcCut1 and BcCut2, that have different roles in infection and host specificity. Botcinic acid (BOA), which is a phytotoxic metabolite that induces chlorosis and necrosis in plant leaves. BOA also inhibits plant defense responses, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity and lignin biosynthesis. 
Genes involved in plant defense responses, such as pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, salicylic acid (SA) signaling genes, jasmonic acid (JA) signaling genes, and ethylene (ET) signaling genes. These genes are often induced by Botrytis cinerea infection and modulate the resistance or susceptibility of plants to the fungus. Genes involved in plant cell wall biosynthesis, such as cellulose synthase (CESA) genes, pectin methylesterase (PME) genes, and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) genes. These genes affect the structure and composition of the plant cell wall, which is a physical barrier and a source of signals for plant defense against Botrytis cinerea.
