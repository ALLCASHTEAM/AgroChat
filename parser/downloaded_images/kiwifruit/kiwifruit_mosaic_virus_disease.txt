Kiwifruit is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruits1. Kiwifruit mosaic virus disease is a viral disease that is caused by the Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)2 3.
CMV is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Cucumovirus and the family Bromoviridae2. It does not have a pathogenic fungus associated with it, so it does not have a mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus. CMV is transmitted by aphids in a nonpersistent manner, meaning that the virus does not multiply or persist in the vector2. It can also be spread by mechanical contact, such as through pruning tools, hands, or clothing2. The epidemiological pattern of CMV depends on the presence and activity of aphid vectors, the availability and distribution of susceptible hosts, and the environmental conditions2.
The period of disease onset for kiwifruit mosaic virus disease varies depending on the time of infection, the cultivar, and the environmental factors3. Generally, the symptoms appear within 10 to 14 days after inoculation3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are mainly related to the temperature and humidity. CMV can infect plants over a wide range of temperatures, from 10 В°C to 32 В°C, but it prefers moderate temperatures of 20 В°C to 25 В°C2. High humidity favors aphid activity and virus transmission2.
CMV can overwinter in perennial weeds or woody hosts that serve as reservoirs for the virus2. It can also survive in infected seeds or plant debris2.
There is no effective chemical control for the virus itself, but insecticides can be used to reduce the population of aphids that transmit the virus. However, insecticides may also kill beneficial insects that prey on aphids, so they should be used with caution and only when necessary. Some examples of insecticides that can be used against aphids are malathion, carbaryl, and pyrethroids1.
Infected plants or plant parts should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent further spread of the virus. Pruning tools, hands, and clothing should be disinfected after handling infected plants to avoid mechanical transmission of the virus1. Seeds should be obtained from certified sources or treated with hot water to eliminate the virus2.
Natural enemies of aphids, such as ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, can help reduce the vector population and the virus transmission. These beneficial insects can be encouraged by planting flowers or herbs that attract them, such as marigolds, yarrow, or mint1.
Crop rotation, intercropping, and weed management can help reduce the host range and the reservoirs of the virus. Avoid planting susceptible crops near or downwind from infected plants or perennial weeds that harbor the virus1. Plant resistant or tolerant varieties of crops when available2.
["This disease are mainly characterized by mosaic patterns on the leaves, which are mottled with yellow, white, and light or dark green spots and streaks1 2.", "The leaves may also be wrinkled, curled, or smaller than normal1 2.", "The plants may be stunted or grow poorly1 2.", "The fruits may be mottled and develop raised вЂњwartyвЂќ areas1."]
["This disease are not very obvious, as the virus itself is microscopic and cannot be seen by the naked eye.", "However, some methods can be used to detect the presence of the virus in the plant tissue, such as RT-PCR, which is a molecular technique that amplifies and identifies the viral RNA3 4.", "Another method is ELISA, which is an immunological technique that uses antibodies to bind and detect the viral proteins2."]

A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is to use a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. This method can detect the presence of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), which is one of the causal agents of kiwifruit mosaic virus disease1. The RT-PCR assay can be performed on leaf samples collected from symptomatic plants and can provide results within a few hours1. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is that the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infects the kiwifruit plants through aphids that act as vectors. The virus enters the plant cells and replicates in the cytoplasm, producing viral proteins and RNA. The virus then moves from cell to cell through plasmodesmata, and from leaf to leaf through the phloem2. The virus can cause symptoms such as light and dark green mosaic, leaf deformation, stunted growth, reduced yield, and fruit mottling2 1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors of CMV are not well known, but some studies have suggested that the coat protein (CP) and the 2b protein may play important roles in viral pathogenicity and host range2. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host susceptibility, the viral strain, and the environmental conditions2.
