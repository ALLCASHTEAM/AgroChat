Kiwifruit is a horticultural crop that is native to warm, forest regions of China and requires a long growing season1. Kiwifruit leaf spot disease can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as fungal, bacterial or oomycete2 3 4. Some examples of fungal pathogens are Phoma sp., Fusarium fujikuroi and Phomopsis sp.3 4 5.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease depends on the species. For example, Phoma sp. produces pycnidia (flask-shaped structures) that contain conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by rain or wind4. Fusarium fujikuroi produces both macroconidia and microconidia (asexual spores) that are also dispersed by rain or wind5. Phomopsis sp. produces pycnospores (asexual spores) that are released from pycnidia2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease also depend on the species. For example, Phoma sp. can infect kiwifruit leaves through wounds or natural openings and cause circular to irregular brown spots with dark margins4. Fusarium fujikuroi can infect kiwifruit leaves through stomata or wounds and cause brown spots with yellow halos5. Phomopsis sp. can infect kiwifruit leaves through wounds or natural openings and cause brown spots with gray centers and dark margins6.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the pathogen species. For example, Phoma sp. can cause leaf spot disease in kiwifruit from April to June in China3. Fusarium fujikuroi can cause leaf spot disease in kiwifruit from May to July in China5. I do not have the information for the period of disease onset for Phomopsis sp. The environmental conditions required for the disease also vary depending on the pathogen species. For example, Phoma sp. prefers high humidity and moderate temperatures (15-25Г‚В°C) for infection and sporulation4. Fusarium fujikuroi prefers high humidity and warm temperatures (25-30Г‚В°C) for infection and sporulation5. I do not have the information for the environmental conditions required for Phomopsis sp.
The overwintering method of this disease depends on the pathogen species. For example, Phoma sp. can overwinter as mycelium or pycnidia in infected plant debris or soil4. Fusarium fujikuroi can overwinter as mycelium or conidia in infected plant debris or soil5. I do not have the information for the overwintering method of Phomopsis sp.
Applying fungicides with high efficiency and low toxicity, such as tetramycin, honokiol, isopyrazam or azoxystrobin1 2 3 4. The application dose, period and number of applications may vary depending on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may also vary depending on the environmental conditions and the pathogen resistance.
Cutting off and destroying the infected parts of the plant, such as leaves, stems and fruits, to prevent the spread of the disease1 5.
Using antagonistic microorganisms, such as chitosan, to inhibit the growth and sporulation of the pathogen and enhance the resistance and photosynthesis of the plant2 3.
Improving the soil drainage and aeration, avoiding overwatering and overcrowding, pruning and thinning the vines regularly, removing plant debris and weeds, and rotating crops with non-host plants1 5.

["Phoma sp.: Black pycnidia (flask-shaped structures) that contain conidia (asexual spores) on the surface of the spots5.", "Fusarium fujikuroi: White or pinkish mycelium (fungal threads) or conidia (asexual spores) on the surface of the spots4.", "Phomopsis sp.: Black pycnidia (flask-shaped structures) that contain pycnospores (asexual spores) on the surface of the spots1."]
Mutation: The pathogen may mutate its genes or chromosomes to alter its sensitivity to the fungicide1. Efflux: The pathogen may pump out the fungicide from its cells using efflux pumps1. Detoxification: The pathogen may degrade or modify the fungicide using enzymes or other molecules1. Target modification: The pathogen may change the structure or expression of the target site of the fungicide to reduce its binding affinity1. Alternative pathway: The pathogen may use an alternative metabolic pathway to bypass the inhibition of the fungicide1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to amplify and detect the specific DNA sequences of the bacteria from the infected plant samples2. This method can identify the bacteria species and strain in a short time and with high accuracy. 
Penetration: The pathogen may penetrate the plant tissue through natural openings (such as stomata or wounds) or by producing specialized structures (such as appressoria or haustoria) that breach the plant cell wall. Colonization: The pathogen may colonize the plant tissue by producing hyphae (fungal threads) or spores that spread through the intercellular spaces or vascular tissues. Pathogenicity: The pathogen may cause disease symptoms by producing toxins, enzymes, hormones or effectors that interfere with the plant metabolism, defense or signaling. 
Cell wall synthesis: The pathogen may target the enzymes or proteins involved in the synthesis or maintenance of the plant cell wall, such as cellulose synthase, pectin methylesterase or expansin. Respiration: The pathogen may target the components or processes involved in the plant respiration, such as cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase or ATP synthase. Photosynthesis: The pathogen may target the components or processes involved in the plant photosynthesis, such as photosystem I, photosystem II, rubisco or Calvin cycle. Defense response: The pathogen may target the components or processes involved in the plant defense response, such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, ethylene or mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Signal transduction: The pathogen may target the components or processes involved in the plant signal transduction, such as calcium, calmodulin, protein kinase C or phospholipase C.
