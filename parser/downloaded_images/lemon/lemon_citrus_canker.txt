The type of crop of lemon is a horticultural crop1 2, which means it is grown for its fruits, flowers, or ornamental value. The type of disease of citrus canker is a bacterial disease3 4 5, which means it is caused by a bacterium called Xanthomonas citri.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic bacterium of citrus canker is binary fission, which means it divides into two identical cells by splitting its DNA and cytoplasm. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of citrus canker are airborne and contact6 4 5, which means the bacterium can be spread by wind, rain, insects, birds, humans, and contaminated tools or equipment.
The period of disease onset for citrus canker is 14 days3, which means the symptoms usually appear within two weeks of exposure to the bacterium. The environmental conditions required for citrus canker are high temperature and high humidity3 4 5, which means the bacterium thrives in warm and moist climates.
The overwintering method of citrus canker is survival in old lesions3, which means the bacterium can remain viable on infected plant surfaces for several months.
Liquid copper fungicides can be used to prevent or reduce citrus canker infection by creating a protective barrier on the plant surface1 2 3. The type, dose, frequency, and timing of fungicide application may vary depending on the product label, the disease severity, and the environmental conditions. Some sources suggest applying fungicides before or during flowering and before or after rainy periods1 . The number of applications may range from two to six per year1 . The control effect of fungicides may depend on the coverage, penetration, and persistence of the product1 .
Pruning and destroying infected branches can help reduce the inoculum and prevent further spread of the disease1 4 . However, pruning should be done carefully to avoid creating wounds that may facilitate bacterial entry. Pruning tools should be disinfected between cuts to avoid cross-contamination1 . Pruning should also be done in dry weather to minimize bacterial dispersal1 .
Biocontrol agents such as antagonistic bacteria or fungi may help suppress citrus canker by competing with or inhibiting the pathogen1 . However, biocontrol agents may have limited efficacy and availability compared to chemical control1 . Some examples of biocontrol agents that have been tested against citrus canker are Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Trichoderma harzianum1 .
Cultural practices such as planting resistant or tolerant cultivars, reducing plant density, using windbreaks, avoiding overhead irrigation, and removing alternate hosts may help prevent or reduce citrus canker infection by enhancing plant health and reducing bacterial exposure1 4 .
["Small yellow spots on the upper surface of leaves, which later turn brown and necrotic5 4 . Orange to brown pustules on the lower surface of leaves, which produce urediniospores5 4 . Raised lesions with a crater-like appearance and concentric circles on fruits, twigs, and leaves5 1 4 . Water-soaked margin and yellow halo around the lesions5 1 4 . Dieback, leaf loss, and fruit dropping in severe cases5 1 4 ."]

The resistance of the phytopathogenic bacterium of citrus canker is influenced by the DMR6 gene in citrus plants1. This gene normally inhibits the plant's ability to defend itself from pathogens that cause citrus canker and possibly huanglongbing (HLB)1. By editing this gene within the plant's DNA, scientists have found that the resulting plants show resistance to citrus canker1. The type of resistance agent is gene editing and the level of resistance is high1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacterium of citrus canker is polymerase chain reaction (PCR)2. This method uses a specific primer to amplify and detect the DNA of Xanthomonas citri in plant samples2. The PCR test can be done in a few hours and has high sensitivity and specificity2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of citrus canker is type III secretion system (T3SS)3. This system allows the bacterium to inject effector proteins into the plant cells and manipulate their functions3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the strain of Xanthomonas citri, but some common ones are XopA, XopE1, XopE2, XopJ, XopK, XopL, XopN, XopQ, XopR, XopT, and AvrGf13. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility between the effectors and the plant resistance genes3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacterium of citrus canker are plant defense-related genes4. For example, knockout lethal genes such as NPR1, EDS1, PAD4, NDR1, RAR1, SGT1, and HSP90 are involved in regulating plant immunity and signaling pathways4. By targeting these genes, the bacterium can suppress the plant's defense response and facilitate its infection4.
