Cabbage is a type of horticultural crop that belongs to the brassica family1. Cabbage virus disease is a viral disease that can be caused by different types of mosaic viruses, such as Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV), Turnip Mosaic Virus (TMV), and Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 2.
The pathogenic agents of cabbage virus disease are not fungi, but viruses. Therefore, they do not have a mode of reproduction that involves conidia or mobile spores. Viruses reproduce by infecting host cells and using their genetic material to make copies of themselves3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of cabbage virus disease depend on the type of virus and the vector involved. The most common vectors are aphids, which can carry the virus from one plant to another by feeding on their sap. Other insects, such as leafhoppers and cucumber beetles, can also transmit some mosaic viruses4. The disease can also spread by direct contact between infected and healthy plants2.
The period of disease onset for cabbage virus disease varies depending on the environmental conditions, the stage of plant growth, and the type and strain of virus. Generally, symptoms appear within two to four weeks after infection. The environmental conditions required for the disease are influenced by the type of virus and the vector involved. Some mosaic viruses can infect plants at a wide range of temperatures, while others are more temperature-sensitive. High humidity and rainfall can favor aphid populations and virus transmission. Soil conditions do not seem to have a direct effect on the disease, but they can affect plant health and resistance.
The overwintering method of this disease depends on the type of virus and the vector involved. Some mosaic viruses can survive in perennial weeds or crop residues that serve as alternative hosts for the virus and the vector2. Others can overwinter in insect vectors that hibernate in protected places.
There is no effective chemical control for the virus itself, but insecticides can be used to reduce the population of aphids and other vectors that transmit the virus. However, insecticides should be used with caution, as they can also harm beneficial insects and pollinators. Some examples of insecticides that can be used against aphids are malathion, carbaryl, and pyrethroids1.
Infected plants or plant parts should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent the spread of the virus. Burning or burying the infected material is recommended2. Crop rotation and sanitation can also help reduce the risk of infection by eliminating alternative hosts and sources of inoculum1.
Natural enemies of aphids and other vectors, such as ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps, and predatory mites, can help suppress their population and limit the transmission of the virus. Planting companion plants that attract or repel aphids, such as marigolds, nasturtiums, garlic, and mint, can also help2.
Planting resistant or tolerant varieties of cabbage and other crops can reduce the impact of the virus. Some examples of resistant varieties are Savoy King F1, Savoy Queen F1, and Savoy Ace F1 for cabbage; Green Magic F1 and Marathon F1 for broccoli; Snow Crown F1 and Cheddar F1 for cauliflower; and Green Wave for mustard3. Planting at optimal times and spacing can also enhance plant vigor and resistance.

["Serological tests: These tests use antibodies that bind specifically to the virus and produce a color change or a fluorescent signal that indicates a positive result. Some examples of serological tests are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunocapture reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR), and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA).", "Molecular tests: These tests use nucleic acid probes that hybridize with the viral genome and amplify it using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other techniques. Some examples of molecular tests are reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA).", "Electron microscopy: This method uses an electron microscope to visualize the virus particles directly from plant extracts or purified preparations. However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and requires specialized equipment and expertise."]
Gene resistance: Some plants are naturally resistant to CMV, TMV and CaMV due to specific resistance genes in their genome. For example, the N gene in tobacco and the Tm-2 gene in tomato provide resistance to CMV. This type of resistance is usually complete, meaning that the plants are fully resistant and cannot be infected by CMV.Induced resistance: Plants infected with CMV, TMV and CaMV can produce specific antibodies that prevent the virus from invading plant cells again, providing induced resistance. This type of resistance is usually partial, meaning that plants can be infected with CMV, TMV and CaMV, but the disease will not be severe.Gene-induced resistance: Some plants can enhance their resistance to CMV, TMV and CaMV by activating specific genes after infection. This type of resistance is also partial, but compared to induced resistance, gene-induced resistance is more persistent.
Nucleic acid amplification technology is mainly based on PCR detection technology, including real-time fluorescent RT-PCR, multiple RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR and other methods, which are widely used in Plant virus detection.
It usually interferes with the RNA splicing pattern of eukaryotic hosts. In virus plant interactions, it is currently unclear whether the change in host variable splicing patterns caused by the virus is a side effect during its infection process, or a mechanism by which the virus regulates host gene expression and is beneficial for its infection and pathogenicity.
Here are some potential targets for these viruses:RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp): This is an essential enzyme for replication of CMV, TMV, and CaMV. Therefore, RdRp is a potential target for these viruses. Studying the structure and function of RdRp can help in developing antiviral drugs targeting these viruses.Proteases: Some proteases in these viruses play crucial roles in virus replication and infection. For example, proteases NIa and NIb in TMV are involved in RNA replication and translation, respectively. Therefore, these proteases are also potential targets for these viruses.Viral capsid proteins: The capsid proteins of these viruses determine their infectivity and immunogenicity. Therefore, these proteins are also potential targets. Researching the structure and function of these proteins can help in developing vaccines and antibodies to prevent these viruses from infecting plants.
