Cabbage is a horticultural crop that belongs to the crucifer family1. Bacterial black spot disease of cabbage is a bacterial disease caused by the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris2 1 3.
The pathogenic bacteriua of this disease does not reproduce by spores, but by binary fission, which is a form of asexual reproduction where one cell divides into two identical cells. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by several factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, irrigation, insect vectors, and plant wounds3. The bacterium can spread by splashing water, infected seeds, contaminated tools, and cruciferous weeds4 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the plant growth stage. The symptoms can appear at any point during the plant's maturation, from germination to heading1. However, the disease is more severe when the infection occurs early in the plant's development3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and wet weather, with temperatures ranging from 18 to 30Г‚В°C and high humidity2 1 3. The bacterium can also survive in dry conditions on plant debris or seeds3.
The overwintering method of this disease is through infected plant residues or seeds that can harbor the bacterium for several years2 1 3. Some bacteria can produce spores, which are dormant cells that can survive in harsh conditions. Spores can be dispersed by wind, water, or insects, and they can remain viable for long periods.
Use of copper-based fungicides or biopesticides that contain Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Apply according to the label instructions and follow the recommended dose, frequency, and pre-harvest interval. Avoid using the same product repeatedly to prevent resistance development. Other common chemicals are: Mancozeb, Oxytetracycline, Streptomycin
Removal and destruction of infected plant parts or whole plants. Sanitization of tools and equipment that come in contact with infected plants. Use of clean water for irrigation and avoid splashing or overhead watering.
Use of beneficial microorganisms that can suppress the pathogen, such as Pseudomonas fluorescens or Streptomyces lydicus. Apply as seed treatments or foliar sprays according to the label instructions. Preferred biological control agents are., <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens,  Bacillus subtilis,</em> and<em> Trichoderma harzianum.</em>
Use of disease-free seeds or seed treatments. Crop rotation with non-cruciferous crops for at least three to four years. Weed control of cruciferous weeds that can host the pathogen. Avoid planting susceptible varieties or use resistant varieties if available. Maintain adequate spacing and ventilation between plants. Avoid wounding or injuring the plants during cultivation or harvesting.
["Yellow or chlorotic patches on the leaf margins that form V-shaped lesions along the veins.", "Brown or black necrotic tissue on the leaf surface or inside the head.", "Wilting, drooping, and dying of leaves and stems.", "Blackening and rotting of veins and vascular tissues."]
["Sweet, sticky xanthan gum exuded by the bacterium that clogs the veins and oozes out of leaf pores or wounds.", "Bacterial streaming from infected plant tissue when observed under a microscope."]
