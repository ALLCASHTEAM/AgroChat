Cabbage is a type of horticultural crop, which means it is grown for its edible parts such as leaves, stems, flowers, or roots1. Bacterial brown spot disease of cabbage is a bacterial disease caused by two different species of bacteria: <em>Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola</em> and<em> Xanthomonas campestris pv. armoraciae</em>1 2.
The pathogenic bacteria of this disease do not have a specific mode of reproduction, but they can multiply by binary fission, which means they split into two identical cells3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The bacteria can spread by splashing water, including irrigation water and rain, and by insects that carry the bacteria on their bodies or in their saliva4 2. The bacteria can also survive on cruciferous weeds and infected plant debris2.
The period of disease onset for this disease depends on the environmental conditions and the level of inoculum. The symptoms can appear as early as two days after infection or as late as several weeks later2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool and wet weather for <em>P. syringae pv. maculicola</em>, which is most active at 61-75 В°F (16-24 В°C), and warm and humid weather for <em>X. campestris pv. armoraciae</em>, which is most active at 77-86 В°F (25-30 В°C)2. The bacteria also need the presence of free moisture for several hours to cause infection2.
The overwintering method of this disease is through survival on plant debris, such as infected leaves, stems, and seeds, or on alternative hosts, such as cruciferous weeds and other cole crops2.
The best way to prevent bacterial leaf spot is to use clean seeds and transplants, and avoid planting in fields where the disease has occurred before1 2.
Other cultural practices that can reduce the risk of infection include using drip irrigation instead of overhead watering, planting in well-drained soil with good air circulation, spacing plants properly to avoid crowding, removing weeds that can harbor the bacteria, and sanitizing tools and equipment1 2.
If the disease is detected early, infected plants or plant parts should be removed and destroyed to prevent further spread1 3.
Chemical control options are limited and may not be very effective against bacterial leaf spot. Some copper-based products may have some suppressive activity, but they need to be applied frequently and before symptoms appear1 2. Always follow label instructions and check for crop safety before using any pesticide.
["Bacterial leaf spot can cause spots to form on the leaves that start out small, becoming dark brown or purple as they increase in size1 3.", "These spots can join together to form angular lesions, which make the leaves look ragged1 2.", "In the case of a severe infection, the foliage can die1 3."]
["Bacterial leaf spot is caused by two different species of bacteria, <em>Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola</em> and <em>Xanthomonas campestris pv. armoraciae</em>1 2.", "These bacteria can be seen as a slimy ooze or a yellowish exudate on the surface of the lesions when the leaves are wet2 3.", "The bacteria can also be isolated and identified in a laboratory using biochemical and molecular tests2."]
The bacteria that cause this disease are <em>Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola</em> and <em>Xanthomonas campestris pv. armoraciae</em>1 2. These bacteria can be resistant to some copper-based products that are used for chemical control1 2. The mechanism of resistance may involve the production of efflux pumps that expel the copper ions from the bacterial cells, or the expression of copper-binding proteins that reduce the toxicity of copper3. 
As mentioned above, there is no phytopathogenic fungus involved in this disease, only bacteria. A quick test method for the bacteria is to observe the slimy ooze or a yellowish exudate on the surface of the lesions when the leaves are wet2 4. Another quick test method is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that can detect and identify the bacteria based on their DNA sequences in less than an hour5. 
The bacteria enter the plant tissue through natural openings such as stomata and hydathodes, or through wounds caused by insects, hail, or mechanical damage1 2. The bacteria multiply and colonize the intercellular spaces of the leaf tissue, causing water-soaked spots that eventually turn brown or purple1 2. The bacteria produce various pathogenic effectors that interfere with the plant's defense responses and cause cell death6. Some of these effectors include type III secreted proteins, such as <em>AvrBsT</em> and <em>AvrRpt2</em>, that trigger plant resistance in some cultivars6 7. The bacteria also secrete extracellular polysaccharides, such as xanthan gum and alginate, that protect them from environmental stresses and help them adhere to the plant surface6 . 
Potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria are genes or proteins that are essential for their survival, growth, or virulence. Some examples of potential targets are: The copper efflux pump gene <em>copA</em>, which confers resistance to copper-based bactericides3. The xanthan gum biosynthesis gene <em>gumD</em>, which is required for extracellular polysaccharide production and bacterial motility. The type III secretion system gene <em>hrcV</em>, which is involved in delivering pathogenic effectors into plant cells7. The quorum sensing gene <em>rpfF</em>, which regulates bacterial cell density and virulence factor expression.
