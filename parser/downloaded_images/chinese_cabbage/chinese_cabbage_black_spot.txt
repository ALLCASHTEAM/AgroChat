Cabbage is a horticultural crop that belongs to the <em>Brassicaceae</em> family1. The black spot disease of cabbage can be caused by different pathogens, but the most common one is <em>Alternaria brassicicola</em>, which is a fungal pathogen2 3.
The mode of reproduction of <em>Alternaria brassicicola</em> is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that can be dispersed by wind, rain, or insects2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of black spot disease of cabbage are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and leaf wetness. The disease is more prevalent in cool and moist conditions, and it can spread by airborne or insect-borne <em>conidia</em>2 4.
The period of disease onset for black spot disease of cabbage depends on the stage of plant growth and the severity of infection. The disease can start as early as the seedling stage, or it can develop later during the heading stage. The symptoms include small yellow spots that enlarge and turn black with concentric rings, and sometimes holes in the leaves2 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are temperatures ranging from 20 to 28Г‚В°C (68 to 82Г‚В°F), relative humidity above 90%, and leaf wetness for more than six hours2 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris or cruciferous weeds in the soil or on the surface2 4.
Fungicides such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper can be applied to prevent or reduce the severity of the disease1 2. The application dose, period, frequency, and effect may vary depending on the product label and the environmental conditions.
Infected leaves and plant debris should be removed and destroyed to reduce the source of inoculum1 2. Avoid overhead irrigation and splashing water that can spread the spores1 2.
Some biopesticides such as <em>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</em> and <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> may have some efficacy against the disease2.
Crop rotation with non-cruciferous crops for at least three years can help break the disease cycle1 2. Plant-resistant or tolerant varieties if available1 2. Maintain adequate spacing and ventilation among plants1 2.
["The disease causes yellow spots that grow larger and develop rings around them like a target or bull's-eye1 2. These spots are usually surrounded by a halo of yellow discoloration1.", "As the tissue dies, the centers may fall out, resulting in holes in the foliage1 2.", "As the disease develops, the spots join together to form large areas of dead tissue1 2.", "The disease can also infect the base of the developing heads, causing black spots and stripes along the leaves and black sooty growth inside the heads3 4."]
["The disease is caused by two species of fungi, Alternaria brassicicola and A. brassicae1 2.", "The fungi produce spores that are dark brown to black in color and have a beak-like projection at one end1 2.", "The spores can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope on the surface or inside the infected tissue1 2.", "I have answered each of your questions based on the information I found on the web. I have cited the sources using the [[number]:(URL)] notation as you requested. Here are the sources:"]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus can develop resistance to fungicides by altering the target site, increasing the efflux of the fungicide, or degrading the fungicide1 2. For example, resistance to QoI fungicides (such as azoxystrobin) is caused by a point mutation in the cytochrome b gene that prevents the binding of the fungicide to the complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain1 2. Type of resistance agent: The fungus can be resistant to different classes of fungicides, such as QoI, DMI, MBC, and SDHI1 2. These fungicides have different modes of action and target different enzymes or pathways in the fungus. Level of resistance: The level of resistance can vary depending on the fungicide, the fungal isolate, and the environmental conditions1 2. Resistance can be qualitative or quantitative, meaning that it can be complete or partial, respectively1. Resistance can also be stable or unstable, meaning that it can persist or decline in the absence of selection pressure1. 
One possible method is to use a molecular diagnostic tool based on PCR (polymerase chain reaction) that can amplify and detect a specific DNA sequence of the fungus from infected plant tissue3 4. This method requires a DNA extraction kit, a PCR machine, a set of primers specific for A. brassicicola, and a gel electrophoresis system to visualize the PCR products3 4. Another possible method is to use a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) that can detect a specific antigen of the fungus from infected plant tissue. This method requires a LFI device that contains an antibody-coated membrane strip and a sample pad that can capture the antigen from a plant extract. The LFI device can produce a color change on the membrane strip if the antigen is present. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus produces various types of effectors that can manipulate host defense responses and facilitate infection . Some examples are: ABRS1: A secreted protein that suppresses host cell death and enhances fungal virulence. ABRE1: A secreted protein that induces host cell death and triggers plant immunity. ABP1: A secreted protease that degrades host proteins and contributes to fungal virulence. ABH1: A secreted hemolysin-like protein that disrupts host membrane integrity and facilitates fungal colonization. The exact number of effectors produced by A. brassicicola is not known, but a genome-wide analysis suggested that there are at least 135 putative effector genes in the fungus. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus can infect a wide range of hosts in the Brassicaceae family, but some plants may show different levels of susceptibility or resistance to the disease . Some factors that may influence the infestation are: Host genotype: Different cultivars or varieties may have different genetic traits that affect their response to the fungus, such as resistance genes, defense-related genes, or metabolic genes . Host phenotype: Different morphological or physiological characteristics may affect the susceptibility or resistance of the plants, such as leaf age, leaf wax, leaf surface area, leaf thickness, stomatal density, or nutrient status . Host environment: Different environmental conditions may affect the interaction between the fungus and the plants, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil pH, soil moisture, or soil fertility .
