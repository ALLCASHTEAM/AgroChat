Cabbage is a horticultural crop that belongs to the <em>Brassicaceae</em> family1. Cabbage blight can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as fungi, bacteria, or water molds. Some of the common diseases are <em>Alternaria </em>leaf spot, bacterial leaf spot, bacterial soft rot, black rot, clubroot, downy mildew, <em>Fusarium </em>yellows, and white mold1 2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of cabbage blight depends on the specific disease. For example, Alternaria leaf spot is caused by two species of fungi, <em>Alternaria brassicicola </em>and <em>A. brassicae</em>, which produce spores called conidia that are dispersed by wind or water1 3 4. Fusarium yellows is caused by a fungus called <em>Fusarium oxysporum </em>f. sp. <em>conglutinans</em>, which produces spores called chlamydospores and microconidia that can survive in the soil for long periods2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of cabbage blight also vary depending on the specific disease. For example, bacterial leaf spot is spread by splashing water, including irrigation water, and by insects5. Clubroot is spread by soil movement, contaminated tools, or infected transplants1. Downy mildew is spread by wind-borne spores that require high humidity and cool temperatures to germinate1.
The period of disease onset for cabbage blight depends on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the host plant. For example, Alternaria leaf spot can develop 2 to 4 weeks after transplanting, but it is more likely to cause disease when moisture is present on the cabbage, and temperatures range from 68 to 81Г‚В°F1. Fusarium yellows can develop symptoms 2 to 4 weeks after transplanting as well, but it is more severe in warm seasons and in soils with pH above 6.52. The environmental conditions required for cabbage blight are different for each disease. For example, Alternaria leaf spot favors warm and humid weather, and prolonged leaf wetness1 3. Bacterial soft rot favors high temperatures and high moisture levels, and can be aggravated by mechanical injuries or insect damage1. Clubroot favors acidic soils with pH below 6.0, and cool and moist conditions1.
The overwintering method of cabbage blight depends on the survival strategy of the pathogen. For example, Alternaria leaf spot can overwinter on infected plant debris or cruciferous weeds1 3. Bacterial soft rot can overwinter in the soil or on infected plant material1. Clubroot can overwinter as resting spores in the soil for up to 20 years1.
Using drip irrigation to reduce leaf wetness and splashing of spores.1
Sanitizing gardening tools to prevent spreading the infection.
Rotating crops with non-cruciferous plants to avoid buildup of pathogens in the soil.
Removing all dead plant material at the end of the growing season to eliminate sources of inoculum.
["According to 1, some of the disease symptoms of cabbage blight are:", "Yellow spots that grow larger and develop rings around them like a target or bullй€ҐжЄљ-eye on the leaves.", "Holes in the foliage as the tissue dies and falls out.", "Large areas of dead tissue as the spots join together.", "According to 2, some more disease symptoms of cabbage blight are:", "A lifeless, yellowish green color overall, but often more noticeable on one side of the plant.", "A lateral warping or curling of the stem and leaves.", "The lower part of the leaf blade adjoining the petiole or midrib wilts and dies first, resulting in a curve in the midrib.", "The lower leaves turn yellow first, and then symptoms move to the upper leaves. With time, the yellow turns brown, and the tissue becomes dry and brittle."]
["According to 3, some of the disease signs of cabbage blight are:", "Root infection, collar region rotten.", "According to 4, some more disease signs of cabbage blight are:", "Dark brown or black spores on the surface of infected leaves or stems."]
According to 1, the phytopathogenic fungus <em>Sclerotinia</em> <em>minor</em> LC41, which causes Sclerotinia blight on lettuce in China, has a high-quality genome resource that can be used to study its resistance mechanisms and potential targets. The authors reported that this fungus has 11,182 protein-coding genes, of which 1,153 are predicted to be secreted proteins that may be involved in pathogenicity. They also identified 14 genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes that may be involved in detoxification of fungicides or plant defense compounds. According to 2, some phytopathogenic fungi have developed resistance to fungicides by various mechanisms, such as target site mutations, overexpression of efflux pumps, degradation or modification of fungicides, or alteration of cellular membranes. The type and level of resistance depend on the mode of action of the fungicide, the genetic variability of the fungus, and the selection pressure exerted by the fungicide use. 
According to 2, phytopathogenic fungi can infect plants by producing various types of spores that can germinate and penetrate the plant tissues directly or through natural openings or wounds. Some fungi can also form specialized structures such as appressoria or haustoria that facilitate adhesion and invasion. Phytopathogenic fungi can secrete a variety of effectors that can modulate plant defense responses, manipulate plant metabolism, or induce cell death. The type and number of effectors vary among different fungal species and strains. The infestation of different plants may depend on the compatibility between the fungal effectors and the plant receptors or resistance genes.
