The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop1, which means it is grown for its edible parts such as leaves, stems, flowers, or roots. The disease type of this disease is a fungal disease2, caused by a species of Cercospora2, which is a genus of fungi that infects many plants.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is a conidium2, which is a type of asexual spore that is produced by the fungus and dispersed by wind or water. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are airborne3 and rain-splash1, which means the fungal spores can travel through the air or be splashed by raindrops onto the leaves of the host plants.
The period of disease onset for this disease is early spring2, when the temperatures are cool and wet, which are favorable for the fungal growth and infection.
The overwintering method of this disease is plant debris2, which means the fungal spores can survive on the dead or decaying plant material left in the soil or on the surface.
Fungicides or sprays containing copper or benomyl can be applied to the plants as soon as the symptoms appear1 2. The fungicides should be reapplied every week or two until the disease is controlled1. However, some fungicides may be toxic to some crucifers, especially cabbage2, so it is important to follow the label instructions carefully.
Infected plants or plant parts should be removed and destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease3 4. The garden tools should also be sanitized after use to avoid contaminating healthy plants5.
There are no known biological agents that can effectively control this disease.
The best way to prevent this disease is to use disease-free seeds or resistant cultivars3 4. Crop rotation, rotating cole crops every 3 years, can also reduce the risk of infection3 4. Planting the seedlings with enough space between them can improve air circulation and reduce moisture on the leaves1. Watering beneath the plants instead of overhead can also prevent rain-splash dispersal of the fungal spores1. Weeds that may harbor the fungus should be cleared from the garden area1.
["White leaf spots: These are circular to irregular spots that range from Г‚Вј to Г‚ВЅ inch (6 mm. to 1 cm.) across and scattered across the leaf1. They start as light tan, dry spots and soon turn to papery white lesions on the leaf surrounded by a halo of yellow or pale green1. The spots grow and merge, reducing the chlorophyll production and causing the leaf to yellow and die1. The spots may also form on the base of the developing heads5.", "Holes in the foliage: As the tissue dies, the centers of the spots may fall out, resulting in holes in the foliage5. This makes the leaves look ragged and unappealing."]
["Fungal spores: These are microscopic structures that are produced by the fungus and can be seen on the surface or underside of the infected leaves1. They are usually black or brown in color and have a cylindrical shape1. They are dispersed by wind or water and can infect new plants.", "Fungal substrates: These are visible structures that are formed by the fungus on or within the plant tissue1. They may include hyphae, which are thread-like filaments that grow and branch out; mycelium, which is a mass of hyphae; or conidiophores, which are specialized hyphae that bear conidia (spores)1."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of white spot disease of cabbage is Pseudocercosporella capsellae1. This fungus can survive on seeds and infect the leaves of cruciferous plants, causing brown or gray spots that turn yellow and fall off1. I could not find any information on the mechanism of resistance, the type of resistance agent, or the level of resistance of this fungus. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of white spot disease of cabbage is to use a lactophenol cotton blue stain to observe the conidia and conidiophores of the fungus under a microscope. The conidia are hyaline, cylindrical, and have 3-7 septa. The conidiophores are branched and have sympodial conidiation. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of white spot disease of cabbage is not well understood, but it may involve the production of toxins by the fungus that damage the plant cells and interfere with the plant defense responses. The type and number of pathogenic effectors of this fungus are unknown, but some studies have suggested that it may secrete cutinases, cellulases, pectinases, and proteases that degrade the plant cell wall and facilitate fungal penetration. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the genetic diversity of the fungus and the host resistance of the plants.
