Cabbage is a horticultural crop that belongs to the brassica family1. Grey spot disease of cabbage is a fungal disease caused by two species of fungi, Alternaria brassicicola and A. brassicae1 2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or water1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by moisture and temperature. The disease is more likely to occur when moisture is present on the cabbage, and temperatures range from 68 to 81В°F3. The fungus can also survive on cruciferous weeds or crop residues, and infect new plants through wounds or natural openings1.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the cultivar. The disease can affect seedlings, mature plants, or harvested heads1. The symptoms usually appear on older leaves first, and then spread to younger leaves and heads1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, warm temperature, and wet foliage1. The fungus thrives in these conditions and produces more spores that can infect new plants1.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on plant debris or infected seeds1. The fungus can persist in the soil for several years, and germinate when favorable conditions return1.
Some fungicides such as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus subtilis can be applied to prevent or treat the disease1. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the severity of the infection. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the cultivar1.
Infected plant parts such as leaves or heads can be removed and destroyed or buried to reduce the source of inoculum2 1 3. This can also improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants1.
There is no specific biological control agent for this disease, but some beneficial microorganisms such as Trichoderma spp. or Pseudomonas spp. may have antagonistic effects against the fungus1. These can be applied as soil amendments or foliar sprays1.
Using disease-free seeds or certified seeds from reputable sources2 1 3.
["Yellow spots that grow larger and develop rings around them like a target or bull -eye1.", "As the tissue dies, the centers may fall out, resulting in holes in the foliage1.", "As the disease develops, the spots join together to form large areas of dead tissue1.", "The fungus can also infect the base of the developing heads, causing them to rot or become discolored1."]
["The presence of black, pinhead-sized dots in concentric rings within the grey lesions. These are the conidia or spores of the fungus that can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope2 1."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus can produce cercosporin, a host-specific toxin that causes oxidative damage to plant cells1. The fungus can also secrete cutinases and cellulases that degrade the plant cuticle and cell wall, facilitating infection1. Type of resistance agent: The fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides such as benzimidazoles and strobilurins by mutating target genes or enhancing detoxification mechanisms1. Level of resistance: The level of resistance depends on the fungicide mode of action, the fungal population, and the environmental conditions. Some studies have reported moderate to high levels of resistance to benzimidazoles and strobilurins in some regions1. 
One possible method is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that can detect specific DNA sequences of the fungus in plant samples1. This method is rapid, sensitive, and specific, and can be performed in a simple device without sophisticated equipment1. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors of the fungus are not well known, but some candidates have been identified by comparative genomics and transcriptomics1. These include necrosis-inducing proteins, cytokinin biosynthesis proteins, small secreted proteins, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis proteins1. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host susceptibility, the fungal virulence, and the environmental factors. Some plants may have partial or complete resistance to the fungus by activating defense responses or limiting lesion growth2 1. Some fungal isolates may have different levels of aggressiveness or toxin production that affect their ability to infect different plants1. Some environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light may also influence the infection process by affecting spore germination, penetration, and lesion development1. 
I do not have information on this item because this disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacteria.
