Cabbage is a horticultural crop that belongs to the Brassica genus of the mustard family1. Cabbage anthracnose is a fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum higginsianum or Colletotrichum dematium2 1 3 4.
The pathogenic fungus of cabbage anthracnose reproduces by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in acervuli1 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of cabbage anthracnose are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and wind. The disease is more severe in cool and wet conditions, and the spores can be dispersed by rain splash, wind, insects and contaminated tools5 1.
The period of disease onset for cabbage anthracnose varies depending on the cultivar, inoculum level and environmental conditions. The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common in young seedlings and mature plants1 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, moderate temperature (between 75-85Г‚В°F) and wet leaves. The fungus can infect the plant through natural openings or wounds2.
The overwintering method of cabbage anthracnose is by surviving on infected plant debris, seeds or soil. The fungus can also persist on alternative hosts such as mustard, turnip, radish and wild radish2 1.
Fungicides such as liquid copper sprays and sulfur powders can be applied weekly, starting when foliage begins to develop in the early spring and continuing throughout the growing season. Neem oil spray can also be used as an organic fungicide/insecticide/miticide that kills eggs, larvae and adult stages of insects as well as prevents fungal attack on plants1.
Infected leaves, fruit or stems should be removed and destroyed. Do not compost infected plant material. Disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use1.
Plant defence elicitors such as benzothiadiazole (BTH) or е°ѕ-amino-n-butyric acid (BABA) can induce resistance in cabbage plants against anthracnose by activating defence genes and pathways2 3.
Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease. Avoid planting cabbage in the same area where anthracnose has occurred previously. Rotate crops with non-host plants such as corn, wheat or soybean. Provide adequate spacing and ventilation for the plants to reduce humidity and leaf wetness. Avoid overhead irrigation and water the plants early in the day1 4.
["Discolored lesions on the cotyledons that turn into necrotic spots on seedlings1.", "Small, angular, light green to yellow lesions on the upper leaf surface that enlarge and form irregularly-shaped necrotic patches on older leaves1 5.", "Pale brown to gray discoloration on the surface of the curd or head, and grayish or black spots on the stem beneath. The interior of the curd or head will become dark brown to black or gray under severe infection1.", "Dark, discolored zones that spread from the crown into the taproot of turnip and radish1."]
["Gray to white masses of spores (sporangia and sporangiaphores) on the undersurface of the leaf, or on both sides of the leaf under favorable conditions1 5.", "Pink, gelatinous masses of spores in the center of the lesions especially during moist, warm weather1."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus can overcome the host defence responses by producing various pathogenic effectors that suppress or manipulate the plant immune system. Some of these effectors are secreted into the apoplast, while others are translocated into the plant cell cytoplasm or nucleus1 2. Type of resistance agent: The fungus can produce secondary metabolites such as melanin, oxalic acid and siderophores that may enhance its virulence and survival1 2. Level of resistance: The fungus can infect a wide range of brassica crops and show different levels of aggressiveness depending on the host genotype and environmental conditions1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that can detect and identify the fungal DNA from infected plant samples. This method can be performed in a laboratory or in the field using portable devices3 4. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus can produce more than 100 pathogenic effectors that can modulate the host defence responses and facilitate its colonization. Some of these effectors are conserved among different Colletotrichum species, while others are specific to C. higginsianum or its host range1 2. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus can infect different brassica crops and cause different symptoms depending on the host susceptibility and resistance. The fungus can also adapt to different host tissues and organs, such as leaves, stems, fruits and roots1 2. 
Knockout lethal genes: The genes that are essential for the survival or growth of the fungus, such as those involved in cell wall biosynthesis, ergosterol synthesis, amino acid metabolism, signal transduction and stress response . Host defence genes: The genes that are involved in the recognition or response of the plant to the fungal infection, such as those encoding receptor-like kinases, transcription factors, pathogenesis-related proteins and hormone biosynthesis or signalling1 2.
