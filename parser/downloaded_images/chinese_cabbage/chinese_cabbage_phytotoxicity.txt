Cabbage is a cruciferous vegetable in the Brassicacae family that includes other popular core crops such as cauliflower, broccoli, kale, and collard greens1 2. It can be classified as a horticultural crop, which is a type of crop that is grown for its edible parts such as leaves, stems, roots, fruits, or flowers. Cabbage drug damage is a type of physiological disease that affects cabbage plants. It is caused by the interaction of certain drugs with the plant's metabolism, resulting in abnormal growth and development. Some of the drugs that can cause cabbage drug damage are antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, hormones, and herbicides.
Cabbage drug damage is not caused by a pathogenic fungus, so it does not have a mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus. However, some of the drugs that can cause cabbage drug damage may also affect the natural fungal flora of the soil or the plant, which may have different modes of reproduction such as conidia, spores, hyphae, or sclerotia. Cabbage drug damage is not transmitted by any vector or agent, but rather by the direct or indirect contact of the plant with the drug. The drug may be applied to the soil, water, air, or plant tissue, either intentionally or unintentionally. The epidemiological pattern of cabbage drug damage depends on the type, dose, timing, and frequency of the drug exposure, as well as the environmental conditions and the genetic susceptibility of the plant.
The period of disease onset for cabbage drug damage varies depending on the type and dose of the drug, as well as the stage of plant growth. Some drugs may cause immediate symptoms, while others may take days or weeks to manifest. Some drugs may affect only certain parts or organs of the plant, while others may affect the whole plant. Some common symptoms of cabbage drug damage are chlorosis, necrosis, wilting, stunting, curling, cracking, bolting, or deformation of the leaves, stems, roots, or heads. The environmental conditions required for cabbage drug damage are not specific to the disease itself, but rather to the drug and its mode of action. Some drugs may be more active or stable under certain temperature, humidity, pH, light, or oxygen levels. Some drugs may also interact with other factors in the environment such as nutrients, microbes, pollutants, or other chemicals. Generally speaking, cabbage plants prefer cool and moist conditions with fertile and well-drained soil and full sun exposure.
Cabbage drug damage does not have an overwintering method because it is not caused by a living organism that can survive unfavorable conditions. However, some of the drugs that cause cabbage drug damage may persist in the soil, water, air, or plant tissue for long periods of time and cause residual effects on subsequent crops or seasons. Therefore, it is important to follow proper management practices such as crop rotation, sanitation, irrigation, fertilization, weed control, and pest control to prevent or reduce cabbage drug damage.
This involves using pesticides or insecticides to kill or repel the pests. The type of agent, application dose, application period, application frequency, and control effect vary depending on the pest and the product. For example, to control aphids, one can use insecticidal soap, neem oil, or pyrethrin-based sprays1. To control cabbage maggots, one can use carbaryl or diazinon granules at planting time2. To control caterpillars, one can use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), spinosad, or pyrethroids2. Chemical control should be used with caution and according to the label instructions, as some pesticides may harm beneficial insects, pollinators, or the environment.
This involves using mechanical or manual methods to remove or exclude the pests. For example, to control aphids, one can use a wet paper towel to gently brush them off the leaves1. To control cabbage maggots, one can use row covers or collars around the base of the plants to prevent the flies from laying eggs2. To control caterpillars, one can handpick them and drop them into a bucket of soapy water2.
This involves using natural enemies or predators to reduce the pest population. For example, to control aphids, one can introduce ladybugs, lacewings, or parasitic wasps that feed on them1. To control cabbage maggots, one can release nematodes that infect and kill them2. To control caterpillars, one can attract birds, spiders, or predatory insects that prey on them2.
This involves using cultural or preventive practices to avoid or minimize pest infestation. For example, to control aphids, one can avoid over-fertilizing or over-watering the plants, as this makes them more susceptible to aphid attack1. To control cabbage maggots, one can rotate crops with non-host plants such as corn or beans2. To control caterpillars, one can plant early or late in the season to avoid peak moth activity2.
["Aphids: They cause yellowing, curling, wilting, or stunting of the leaves. They also produce honeydew, a sticky substance that attracts ants and promotes fungal growth1.", "Cabbage maggots: They cause wilting, yellowing, or dying of the plants. They also create tunnels and holes in the roots and stems2.", "Caterpillars: They cause holes, notches, or skeletonization of the leaves. They also damage the heads by boring into them or leaving frass (excrement) behind2.", "Flea beetles: They cause small round holes or pits on the leaves. They also reduce plant vigor and yield2.", "Slugs and snails: They cause irregular holes or ragged edges on the leaves. They also leave slimy trails behind2.", "Spider mites: They cause yellowing, bronzing, or speckling of the leaves. They also create fine webbing on the undersides of the leaves2.", "Stink bugs: They cause yellowing or browning spots on the leaves and heads. They also inject toxins that affect plant growth and quality2.", "Whiteflies: They cause yellowing, curling, wilting, or stunting of the leaves. They also produce honeydew and transmit viral diseases2.", "Wireworms: They cause wilting or dying of seedlings. They also create holes in the roots and stems2."]
["There are many phytopathogenic fungi that can cause diseases in cabbage, such as Alternaria brassicicola, A. brassicae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Fusarium oxysporum and Leptosphaeria maculans3 4. The resistance mechanisms of these fungi may vary depending on the host plant, the environmental conditions and the genetic factors. Some possible resistance mechanisms are:", "Producing toxins that inhibit the growth of other microorganisms or damage the plant cells3.", "Developing efflux pumps that expel fungicides or plant defense compounds from the fungal cells3.", "Altering the target site of fungicides or plant defense compounds to reduce their binding affinity3.", "Modifying the metabolic pathways to degrade or detoxify fungicides or plant defense compounds3.", "Increasing the genetic diversity and recombination to generate new variants that can overcome resistance3."]
Alternaria brassicicola and A. brassicae have shown resistance to benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) and quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) in some regions1. The level of resistance may range from low to high depending on the fungicide and the fungal isolate1. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum has shown resistance to benzimidazoles and dicarboximides in some regions1. The level of resistance may be moderate to high depending on the fungicide and the fungal isolate1. Fusarium oxysporum has shown resistance to benzimidazoles, carbamates, phenylamides and strobilurins in some regions1. The level of resistance may be low to high depending on the fungicide and the fungal isolate1. Leptosphaeria maculans has shown resistance to QoIs in some regions1. The level of resistance may be moderate to high depending on the fungicide and the fungal isolate1. 
cabbage diseases is the use of molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR (qPCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or DNA microarrays2 3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of cabbage diseases by fungi involves several steps, such as spore germination, appressorium formation, penetration, colonization, symptom development and sporulation. Some factors that influence these steps are:The type and number of pathogenic effectors, which are molecules secreted by the fungus that can manipulate the plant defense system, induce cell death, suppress immunity, modulate metabolism or facilitate nutrient uptake.
