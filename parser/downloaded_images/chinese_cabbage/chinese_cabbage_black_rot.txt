Cabbage is a type of horticultural crop, which means it is grown for its edible parts such as leaves, stems, flowers or roots1. Black rot of cabbage is a bacterial disease, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc)2 1 3 4 5.
The bacterium Xcc does not have a fungal stage, so it does not produce spores. It reproduces by binary fission, which means it splits into two identical cells5. The bacterium Xcc can spread by various means, such as infected seeds, transplants, plant debris, weed hosts, insect vectors, splashing water, and contaminated tools6 1 3 4. The disease is more likely to occur in warm and humid conditions1 3.
The period of disease onset for black rot of cabbage depends on several factors, such as the temperature, the inoculum level, and the plant susceptibility. In general, symptoms can appear from 10 days to several weeks after infection1 3. The environmental conditions required for black rot of cabbage are warm temperatures (around 80В°F or 27В°C) and high humidity (above 90%)1 3. The bacterium Xcc can also survive in a wide range of soil pH levels (from 5.0 to 8.0), but prefers slightly acidic soils (around 6.0)4.
The bacterium Xcc can overwinter in infected plant debris or weed hosts in the soil2 1 3. It can also survive on or in seed coats for several years1.
Chemical control of black rot is not very effective, but some copper-containing fungicides that are labeled for use on cruciferous vegetables may help limit additional disease development when disease severity is low1. However, copper can be toxic to plants and the environment, so it should be used with caution and according to label instructions2.

Biological control of black rot is still under research, but some studies have shown that certain strains of bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) or fungi (e.g. Streptomyces exfoliatus) can inhibit the growth of Xcc and reduce disease incidence and severity3 4. However, these biological agents may not be readily available or effective under field conditions, so they should be used as a supplement to other control measures3.

["The disease symptoms of black rot are irregular, dull, yellow blotches that appear on the edges of leaves1. These blotches expand into V-shaped areas with the wide part of the вЂњVвЂќ at the edge of the leaf and the point of the вЂњVвЂќ toward the attachment point of the leaf to the plant1. The V-shaped areas are initially yellow, but eventually become brown and necrotic (i.e., dead) in the center with a yellow border or halo1. The affected leaves may also droop and die as the disease progresses2.", "Black rot can affect cruciferous plants at any stage of growth, from germination to heading2. The disease may also cause wilting, stunting, and poor head formation in infected plants5 1.", "Diseased plants may rot quickly before or after harvest because of secondary infection from bacterial soft-rot5."]
["The disease signs of black rot are the physical evidence of the pathogen itself on the plant. The most characteristic sign is the blackening and rotting of veins in affected leaves, forming a net-like pattern that is often most visible when leaves are held up to the light1. This is caused by the bacteria exuding sweet, sticky xanthan which clogs the veins, hence the name вЂњblack rotвЂќ2.", "Another sign is the presence of bacterial ooze on leaf surfaces or wounds, which may appear as white or yellow droplets that dry into crusts or scales2 1. This ooze can spread the bacteria to other plants through water splashes or insect vectors2.", "A third sign is the discoloration of interior stem tissue (specifically the water conducting tissue), which will also turn brown or black as the bacteria move systemically through the plant1."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), which is a bacterium that causes black rot in cruciferous plants1 2 3 4 5. The mechanism of resistance of Xcc is not well understood, but some studies have suggested that it involves efflux pumps, biofilm formation, quorum sensing, and antibiotic degradation. The type of resistance agent that Xcc uses is mainly antibiotics, such as streptomycin and copper. The level of resistance of Xcc varies depending on the strain, the host plant, and the environmental conditions. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect Xcc DNA in plant samples. PCR is a molecular technique that amplifies a specific region of DNA using primers and enzymes. PCR can be performed in a laboratory or in the field using portable devices. PCR can identify Xcc within hours and has high sensitivity and specificity. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is bacterial invasion and toxin production. Xcc enters the plant through natural openings or wounds and colonizes the xylem vessels, which transport water and nutrients. Xcc produces a toxin called campestrin, which causes cell death and tissue necrosis. Campestrin also induces the expression of pathogenicity factors, such as type III secretion system (T3SS) and effectors, which help Xcc to evade plant defenses and manipulate host responses. The type and number of pathogenic effectors that Xcc uses are about 28 different proteins that have various functions, such as suppressing plant immunity, altering plant hormone signaling, inducing cell death, and modulating plant metabolism. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host specificity and virulence of Xcc strains, as well as the genetic resistance and environmental stress of the plants. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are genes involved in plant immunity, such as receptor-like kinases (RLKs), nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. These genes encode for proteins that recognize Xcc molecules and activate defense responses, such as oxidative burst, callose deposition, salicylic acid synthesis, and programmed cell death. Knockout or mutation of these genes can make plants more susceptible to Xcc infection.
