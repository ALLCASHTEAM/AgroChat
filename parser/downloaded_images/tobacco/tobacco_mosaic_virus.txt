Tobacco is a type of cash crop, meaning it is grown for sale rather than for personal use by the farmer. 1 Tobacco mosaic disease is caused by a viral infection, specifically by Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). 1 2
Since the disease is viral, there is no pathogenic fungus involved. Therefore, this question is not applicable. The mode of transmission of TMV is mainly through mechanical contact, such as handling infected plants, then healthy plants, or using contaminated tools or surfaces. TMV can also be transmitted by some insects, such as bees and grasshoppers, through casual contact or feeding. 3
The period of disease onset for TMV depends on several factors, such as the plant species, the virus strain, the environmental conditions and the inoculum dose. Generally, symptoms appear within a few days to a few weeks after infection. The environmental conditions required for TMV infection are not very specific, as the virus can infect a wide range of plants under various temperatures and humidity levels. However, some studies have shown that high temperatures (above 30Г‚В°C) and low humidity (below 60%) can reduce the susceptibility of some plants to TMV.
TMV can overwinter in infected plants (including viable seeds) or plant debris that remain in the soil or on the surface. TMV can also survive in plant-based products, such as tobacco products, that may contain infectious virus particles. TMV is very stable and can persist for long periods of time in these sources. 2
There are no effective chemical treatments for TMV infection. However, some disinfectants, such as bleach or Virkon S, can be used to sanitize tools and surfaces that may be contaminated with the virus. 1 2
Infected plants and plant debris should be removed and destroyed by burning or burying. Infected seeds can be treated with hot water (50 в„ѓ for 30 minutes) to reduce the virus load. 2 3
There are no known biological agents that can control TMV infection. However, some plants may have natural resistance or tolerance to the virus, such as some varieties of tomato and pepper. 2 4
Crop rotation, weed control, and sanitation practices can help reduce the sources and spread of TMV. Avoid planting susceptible crops near tobacco fields or warehouses. Avoid handling tobacco products before working with plants. Wash hands and tools thoroughly after touching infected plants. Use certified virus-free seeds or transplants. 2 4
["Mosaic: A blotchy pattern of light and dark green areas on the leaves, giving a mosaic-like appearance.", "Mottling: A yellowish or pale green discoloration of the leaves, often intermixed with normal green color.", "Distortion: A curling, cupping, elongation (strapping), roughening, wrinkling and other growth distortions of the leaves and fruits.", "Stunting: A reduced growth and size of the whole plant or parts of it."]
["Serological tests: These tests use antibodies that bind specifically to TMV antigens and produce a color change or a fluorescent signal that indicates a positive result.", "Molecular tests: These tests use techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nucleic acid hybridization that amplify or detect TMV genetic material (RNA) in plant samples.", "Bioassays: These tests use indicator plants that are highly susceptible to TMV and show characteristic symptoms when inoculated with infected plant sap."]


The mechanism of TMV infection involves the entry of the virus particles into the plant cells through wounds or natural openings (such as stomata). The virus particles then release their RNA genome into the cytoplasm, where it is translated into viral proteins by the host ribosomes. The viral proteins include a replicase that copies the viral RNA into a complementary strand, forming a double-stranded RNA intermediate. The replicase then uses this intermediate as a template to produce more copies of the viral RNA, which are either packaged into new virus particles or used for further translation. The virus particles then exit the cell by breaking the cell wall or membrane, or by hitchhiking on plasmodesmata (cytoplasmic bridges between adjacent cells). The virus can also move systemically within the plant through the phloem (vascular tissue that transports sugars and other organic molecules). The viral infection interferes with the normal metabolism and development of the plant cells, causing various symptoms such as mosaic, mottling, distortion and stunting. 1 2
