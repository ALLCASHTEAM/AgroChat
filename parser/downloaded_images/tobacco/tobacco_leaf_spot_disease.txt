Tobacco is a cash crop that is cultivated for its leaves, which are used for smoking, chewing, or snuff1. Tobacco spot disease can be caused by different types of fungi, such as Cercospora nicotianae, Alternaria alternata, or Rhizoctonia solani1 2 3. These fungi cause different types of leaf spots, such as frogeye leaf spot, brown spot, or target spot1 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungi of tobacco spot disease varies depending on the species. For example, Cercospora nicotianae produces conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or rain4, while Rhizoctonia solani produces sclerotia (hardened masses of hyphae) that can survive in the soil2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of tobacco spot disease also depends on the type of fungus. For example, Cercospora nicotianae infects lower, more mature leaves of the plant and is favored by warm and humid conditions5, while Rhizoctonia solani infects all leaves of the plant and is favored by moderate temperatures and prolonged periods of leaf wetness3. Both fungi can be transmitted by wind, rain, irrigation, or mechanical means4 3.
The period of disease onset for tobacco spot disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the stage of plant growth. For example, Cercospora nicotianae can infect plants at any time during the growing season, but is more common in late summer and early fall4, while Rhizoctonia solani can infect plants from transplanting to harvest, but is more severe in mid to late season3. The environmental conditions required for tobacco spot disease are different for each fungus. For example, Cercospora nicotianae requires temperatures between 20Г‚В°C and 30Г‚В°C and relative humidity above 90% for infection and sporulation4, while Rhizoctonia solani requires temperatures between 15Г‚В°C and 25Г‚В°C and leaf wetness for at least 12 hours for infection and lesion development3.
The overwintering method of tobacco spot disease depends on the type of fungus and its survival structures. For example, Cercospora nicotianae overwinters as conidia on infected plant debris or weeds4, while Rhizoctonia solani overwinters as sclerotia in the soil or on plant residues3.
Cercospora nicotianae, which causes frogeye leaf spot, there are no conventional fungicides available, so cultural practices such as crop rotation, weed control, and removal of infected plant debris are recommended1.
Rhizoctonia solani, which causes target spot, some fungicides such as azoxystrobin and flutriafol have been shown to be effective, but they should be applied before the onset of symptoms and rotated with different modes of action to prevent resistance2.
Alternaria alternata, which causes brown spot, some fungicides such as chlorothalonil and mancozeb have been reported to reduce disease severity, but they should be used in combination with cultural practices such as avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization and irrigation3.

["Cercospora nicotianae causes round or oval lesions with a dark brown margin and a pale tan/white center, sometimes with a yellow halo around them1.", "Rhizoctonia solani causes large lesions with alternating rings of light and dark brown, resembling a target2.", "Alternaria alternata causes irregular-shaped lesions that are dark brown and may coalesce to form large necrotic areas3."]
["Cercospora nicotianae produces black stroma (asexual reproductive structures) in the center of the lesions, from which long, curved, multi-septate conidia (asexual spores) emerge1.", "Rhizoctonia solani produces sclerotia (hardened masses of hyphae) in the soil or on plant residues, which can be seen as small black dots2.", "Alternaria alternata produces conidia that are short, thick, and have transverse and longitudinal septa, giving them a beak-like appearance3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungi of tobacco spot disease to fungicides or host resistance genes may vary depending on the type and strain of the fungus. For example, Cercospora nicotianae has been reported to develop resistance to benzimidazole and strobilurin fungicides, which are commonly used for leaf spot control1. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the target genes of the fungicides, such as beta-tubulin and cytochrome b1. Similarly, Rhizoctonia solani has been found to develop resistance to azoxystrobin, a strobilurin fungicide, due to mutations in cytochrome b2. On the other hand, Alternaria alternata has been shown to be sensitive to most fungicides, except for dicarboximides and phenylpyrroles, which induce cross-resistance3. The mechanism of resistance involves overexpression of efflux pumps that reduce the accumulation of fungicides in the fungal cells3. As for host resistance genes, there are no known genes that confer resistance to tobacco spot disease in tobacco. However, some quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified that affect the resistance to Cercospora nicotianae or Rhizoctonia solani in tobacco4 5. These QTL may be associated with different aspects of plant defense, such as cell wall reinforcement, oxidative burst, or phytoalexin production4 5. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungi of tobacco spot disease is to use molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the specific DNA sequences of the fungi from plant samples. For example, a PCR-based method has been developed to detect Cercospora nicotianae from infected tobacco leaves using primers that target the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the fungal ribosomal DNA. Similarly, a LAMP-based method has been developed to detect Rhizoctonia solani from infected tobacco stems using primers that target the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of the fungal ribosomal DNA. These methods are rapid, sensitive, and specific for identifying the causal agents of tobacco spot disease. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of tobacco spot disease depends on the type of fungus and its mode of infection. For example, Cercospora nicotianae infects tobacco leaves through natural openings such as stomata or wounds using a specialized infection structure called appressorium. The fungus then grows inside the leaf tissues and produces toxins that cause necrosis and chlorosis. The fungus also secretes various enzymes that degrade the plant cell wall components such as cellulose, pectin, and lignin. The fungus may also produce some pathogenic effectors that modulate the plant immune response, such as necrosis-inducing proteins or small secreted proteins. The number and type of effectors may vary depending on the strain of the fungus and its host range. For example, some strains of Cercospora nicotianae can infect other plants such as tomato or pepper, while others are host-specific to tobacco. Rhizoctonia solani infects tobacco stems and roots through direct penetration using hyphae or infection cushions. The fungus then colonizes the cortical tissues and causes lesions and wilting. The fungus also produces toxins that inhibit plant growth and induce cell death. The fungus may also secrete some pathogenic effectors that interfere with the plant defense signaling, such as small cysteine-rich proteins or carbohydrate-active enzymes. The number and type of effectors may vary depending on the anastomosis group (AG) of the fungus and its host specificity. For example, some AGs of Rhizoctonia solani can infect a wide range of plants, while others are more restricted to certain hosts.
