Tobacco is a cash crop that is grown for its leaves, which are used for making cigarettes, cigars, and other products 1 2. The type of disease of this disease is a viral disease3, caused by Potato virus Y (PVY), a monopartite, single stranded RNA virus1 2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is not applicable, as PVY is not a fungus but a virus3 1 2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are aphidtransmitted3 1. PVY can also be transmitted by mechanical means such as contaminated tools or equipment1.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the strain of PVY, the host plant, and the environmental conditions1. In general, PVY symptoms appear within 10 to 14 days after infection in tobacco, and within 3 to 6 weeks after infection in potato1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid3 1. PVY infection is favored by temperatures between 20В°C and 30В°C, and high relative humidity1.
The overwintering method of this disease is through infected tubers or seeds3 1. PVY can survive in dormant tubers or seeds and infect new plants when they sprout1.
The use of insecticides to reduce the population of aphid vectors can reduce the spread of PVY, but it is not very effective as aphids can transmit the virus in a very short time before they are killed by the insecticide1 2. Some systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid can provide some protection against PVY transmission by aphids, but they are not recommended for environmental and health reasons2.
The removal of infected plants (roguing) can reduce the source of PVY inoculum and slow down the disease spread, but it requires frequent and careful inspection of the plants and accurate identification of PVY symptoms, which can be difficult as some strains and varieties show mild or no symptoms1 2. The use of virus-free seed tubers or certified seed lots is essential to prevent the introduction of PVY into new fields1 2.
There is no known biological control agent for PVY, but some natural enemies of aphids such as ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps can help reduce the vector population and thus the disease spread2.
The use of resistant or tolerant varieties can reduce the impact of PVY on yield and quality, but there is no variety that is completely immune to all strains of PVY1 2. Some varieties that have moderate resistance to PVY include: Atlantic, Kennebec, Katahdin, Norland, Russet Burbank, and Superior2. Crop rotation with non-host crops can also reduce the inoculum level and break the disease cycle1 2. The use of reflective mulches or intercropping with non-host plants can also deter aphid colonization and PVY transmission2.

["The disease signs of this disease are not very obvious, as PVY is a virus that cannot be seen by naked eye. However, some methods can be used to detect the presence of PVY in plant tissues, such as serological tests (ELISA), molecular tests (PCR), or indicator plants (such as Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi-nc which shows a hypersensitive response to PVYN)1 2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not applicable, as PVY is not a fungus but a virus1 2 3. However, some plants have resistance or tolerance to PVY infection, which can be acquired through mass selection, X-ray induced mutagenesis and introgressions from wild Nicotiana species4 5. The resistance mechanism involves the recognition of PVY by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and the activation of defense responses4 . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is not applicable, as PVY is not a bacterium but a virus1 2 3. However, some methods can be used to detect the presence of PVY in plant tissues, such as serological tests (ELISA), molecular tests (PCR), or indicator plants (such as Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi-nc which shows a hypersensitive response to PVYN)2 3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the entry of PVY into plant cells through wounds or aphid mouthparts, the replication of PVY RNA in the cytoplasm, the movement of PVY from cell to cell through plasmodesmata, and the systemic spread of PVY through the phloem1 2 3. PVY encodes several proteins that act as pathogenic effectors, such as helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro), nuclear inclusion a-proteinase (NIa-Pro), and cylindrical inclusion protein (CI), which can suppress plant defense responses, modulate plant gene expression, and facilitate virus movement1 2 3. The infestation of different plants by PVY depends on the compatibility between the virus strain and the host genotype, as well as the environmental conditions2 3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not applicable, as PVY is not a bacterium but a virus1 2 3. However, some potential targets for controlling PVY infection are eIF4E and its isoforms, which are essential for PVY recognition and resistance in plants4 . Knocking out or silencing eIF4E genes can confer resistance to PVY in susceptible plants4 .
