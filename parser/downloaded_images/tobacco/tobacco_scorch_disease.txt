Tobacco is a type of cash crop that is grown for its leaves, which are used to make cigarettes and other products that contain nicotine1. Tobacco scorch disease is a viral disease that is caused by the Tobacco necrosis virus (TNV), which belongs to the genus Necrovirus in the family Tombusviridae2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic virus of this disease is by RNA replication inside the host cells. The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome that encodes four proteins: a coat protein, a movement protein, a replicase and a suppressor of RNA silencing3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are soilborne and mechanical. The virus can survive in soil for several years and infect the roots of tobacco plants through wounds or natural openings. The virus can also be transmitted by contaminated tools, equipment, hands or clothing4.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually in the late summer or early autumn, when the soil temperature is favorable for the virus infection4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high soil moisture and moderate to high soil temperature (15-25В°C). The disease is more severe in poorly drained soils and under irrigation4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by persisting in soil or in infected plant debris. The virus can also overwinter in some weed hosts, such as chickweed, shepherd's purse and groundsel4.
Applying appropriate fungicides to the soil before planting or during the growing season can help to reduce the infection by the virus. However, fungicides cannot cure the infected plants and may have negative effects on the environment and human health1.
Removing and destroying the infected plants or plant parts can help to prevent the spread of the virus to healthy plants. However, this method may not be feasible for large-scale production and may not eliminate the virus from the soil1.
There is no known biological agent that can effectively control this disease. However, some studies have suggested that using antagonistic microorganisms, such as Trichoderma spp., Bacillus spp., or Pseudomonas spp., may have some potential to suppress the virus infection or enhance the plant resistance2.
Practicing crop rotation, planting resistant varieties, avoiding over-fertilization and overhead irrigation, controlling nematodes and weeds, and using clean tools and equipment can help to reduce the risk of this disease1 3.
["Necrotic lesions: The infected leaves develop brown or black spots or patches that may coalesce and form irregular patterns. The lesions may also appear on the stems, petioles, and flowers1.", "Chlorosis: The infected leaves show yellowing or bleaching of the tissues around the necrotic lesions or along the veins. The chlorosis may spread to the whole leaf or plant1.", "Wilting: The infected plants show wilting or drooping of the leaves and stems due to the reduced water uptake and transpiration. The wilting may be more pronounced during hot and dry conditions1.", "Stunting: The infected plants show reduced growth and development due to the impaired photosynthesis and respiration. The plants may also produce fewer and smaller flowers and fruits1."]
["Virus particles: The virus particles can be detected by using electron microscopy, serological tests, molecular techniques, or bioassays. However, these methods require specialized equipment and expertise and may not be available for routine diagnosis.", "Virus symptoms: The virus symptoms can be observed by visual inspection of the infected plants or plant parts. However, these symptoms may vary depending on the plant variety, environmental conditions, and virus strain and may be confused with other diseases or disorders."]
RNA silencing suppression: The virus can produce a protein that suppresses the host RNA silencing defense system, which is a natural mechanism to degrade viral RNA and prevent its replication1. Host adaptation: The virus can mutate and adapt to different host plants and environmental conditions, which may affect its virulence and resistance2. Antagonistic interactions: The virus can interfere with the infection or replication of other viruses that may compete for the same host resources or induce stronger host resistance responses. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic virus of the disease is by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which is a technique that uses antibodies to detect the presence of the virus in plant samples. This method is relatively simple, fast, and sensitive, but it requires specific antibodies and equipment. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is by using movement proteins and replicase proteins to invade and replicate in the host cells. The movement proteins help the virus to move from cell to cell through plasmodesmata, which are channels that connect adjacent cells. The replicase proteins help the virus to synthesize new viral RNA using the host cell machinery. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic virus of the disease are not well known, but some studies have suggested that some genes involved in plant immunity, photosynthesis, cell wall biosynthesis, and stress responses may be affected by the virus infection.
