Tobacco is a cash crop that is grown for its leaves, which are used to produce tobacco cigarettes, cigars and snuff or for pesticide production1. Tobacco Common Foliar Disease is a general term that can refer to several diseases that affect the leaves of tobacco plants, such as target spot, frogeye, blue mold, black shank and Pythium root rot2 3. These diseases can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as fungi, oomycetes or bacteria4 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease depends on the specific disease and fungus involved. For example, target spot is caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, which reproduces by producing sclerotia (hardened masses of fungal tissue) and mycelium (branching filaments) in the soil3. Blue mold is caused by the oomycete Peronospora tabacina, which reproduces by producing sporangia (sac-like structures that release spores) and zoospores (motile spores) on the leaf surface3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease also depends on the specific disease and pathogen involved. For example, target spot is favored by high humidity and warm temperatures, and the pathogen spores can be blown into the transplant greenhouse from weedy areas or carried by water splashing5. Blue mold is favored by cool and moist conditions, and the pathogen spores can be dispersed by wind, rain, insects or human activities3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the specific disease and environmental conditions. For example, target spot can occur at any stage of plant growth, but is most common in the transplant stage2. Blue mold can occur at any stage of plant growth, but is most severe in the early to mid-season3. The environmental conditions required for the disease depend on the specific disease and pathogen involved. For example, target spot requires high humidity (&gt;90%) and warm temperatures (25-30В°C) for infection and disease development2. Blue mold requires cool (10-25В°C) and moist conditions for infection and sporulation3.
The overwintering method of this disease depends on the specific disease and pathogen involved. For example, target spot can overwinter as sclerotia or mycelium in the soil or on plant debris2. Blue mold can overwinter as oospores (sexual spores) in the soil or on plant debris, or as mycelium in infected plants or seeds3.
Applying appropriate fungicides to the soil or to the foliage can help to reduce the disease severity and spread. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications and control effect depend on the specific fungicide and disease. For example, for blue mold, fungicides such as mancozeb, chlorothalonil or metalaxyl can be applied at 7-10 day intervals or when disease is forecasted. For black shank, fungicides such as mefenoxam or dimethomorph can be applied at transplanting and repeated every 3-4 weeks1.
Removing and destroying infected plant parts or debris can help to reduce the inoculum sources and prevent further infection. For example, for target spot, removing infected leaves and stems can reduce disease spread2. For black shank, destroying stalks and roots immediately after harvest can reduce overwintering sites for the pathogen1.
Using beneficial organisms such as bacteria, fungi or nematodes that can antagonize or parasitize the pathogen can help to suppress the disease. For example, for Pythium root rot, applying biological agents such as Bacillus subtilis or Trichoderma harzianum can enhance plant growth and reduce disease incidence2.
Using cultural practices such as crop rotation, resistant varieties, weed management, proper fertilization and irrigation can help to prevent or reduce the disease. For example, for target spot, rotating the crop away from tobacco for at least one year and using resistant varieties can help to reduce disease pressure2. For blue mold, avoiding over fertilization and overhead irrigation can help to avoid favorable conditions for the pathogen3.
["Target spot: Circular to irregular brown lesions with concentric rings on leaves and stems; lesions may coalesce and cause leaf blight; defoliation may occur2.", "Frogeye: Small circular brown lesions with light brown centers on leaves; lesions may have yellow halos; lesions may coalesce and cause leaf blight; defoliation may occur.", "Blue mold: Pale green to yellow spots on upper leaf surface; grayish-white downy growth on lower leaf surface; spots may enlarge and coalesce; leaves may curl and wilt; systemic infection may cause stunting and distortion of plants.", "Black shank: Yellowing and wilting of leaves; dark brown to black lesion at the base of the stem; blackening of pith with distinct disks and white hyphae when cut open1.", "Pythium root rot: Browning and rotting of roots; stunting and wilting of plants; damping-off of seedlings2."]
["Target spot: Dark brown sclerotia or white mycelium of Rhizoctonia solani in the soil or on plant debris2.", "Frogeye: No distinctive signs of Cercospora nicotianae on plant tissue.", "Blue mold: Grayish-white sporangia or zoospores of Peronospora tabacina on lower leaf surface or on other plant parts.", "Black shank: White hyphae or oospores of Phytophthora nicotianae in infected tissue or in soil1.", "Pythium root rot: White mycelium or sporangia of Pythium spp. on infected roots or in soil2."]
Resistance to fungicides: Some fungi can develop resistance to fungicides by altering their target sites, detoxifying the fungicides, or reducing their uptake or translocation1. For example, Phytophthora nicotianae, the causal agent of black shank, can develop resistance to mefenoxam by mutating its cytochrome b gene1. Resistance to host defense: Some fungi can evade or suppress host defense responses by producing effectors, toxins, or enzymes that interfere with host recognition, signaling, or cell wall integrity2. For example, Peronospora tabacina, the causal agent of blue mold, can produce RXLR effectors that modulate host immunity and facilitate infection2. Resistance to environmental stress: Some fungi can adapt to environmental stress by producing stress-responsive proteins, antioxidants, or osmolytes that protect them from oxidative damage, osmotic shock, or temperature fluctuations2. For example, Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of target spot, can produce heat shock proteins that enhance its thermotolerance2. 
ELISA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a method that uses antibodies to detect specific antigens of bacteria in plant samples. This method is rapid, sensitive, and specific, but requires specialized equipment and reagents3. PCR: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method that uses primers to amplify specific DNA sequences of bacteria in plant samples. This method is highly sensitive, specific, and versatile, but requires expensive equipment and skilled personnel3. LAMP: Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a method that uses primers and a polymerase to amplify specific DNA sequences of bacteria in plant samples under isothermal conditions. This method is simple, rapid, and sensitive, but may be affected by inhibitors or contaminants3. 
Attachment and penetration: The pathogen attaches to the host surface by using adhesins, pili, flagella, or hydrophobins. The pathogen then penetrates the host cell wall by using appressoria, haustoria, or enzymes2. For example, Peronospora tabacina attaches to the leaf surface by using hydrophobins and penetrates the stomata by using appressoria2. Infection and colonization: The pathogen infects and colonizes the host tissue by using hyphae, mycelium, or spores. The pathogen then obtains nutrients from the host by using haustoria, plasmodesmata, or enzymes2. For example, Phytophthora nicotianae infects and colonizes the root and stem tissue by using hyphae and sporangia. The pathogen then obtains nutrients from the host by using haustoria and plasmodesmata1. Pathogenicity and virulence: The pathogen causes disease symptoms and reduces host fitness by producing effectors, toxins, or enzymes that interfere with host recognition, signaling, metabolism, or cell integrity2. For example, Rhizoctonia solani causes target spot symptoms and reduces leaf quality by producing necrosis-inducing proteins that trigger host cell death2.
