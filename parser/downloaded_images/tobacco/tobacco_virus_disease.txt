Tobacco is a type of cash crop that is grown for its leaves, which are used to make cigarettes and other products. 1 Tobacco virus disease is a type of viral disease that is caused by various species of tobamoviruses, such as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), tobacco vein distorting virus (TVDV) and tobacco bushy top virus (TBTV). 2 3
The pathogenic viruses of tobacco virus disease do not have a fungal stage, so they do not reproduce by spores. They reproduce by replicating their RNA genome inside the host plant cells using the host's machinery. 4 The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of tobacco virus disease vary depending on the virus species and the environmental conditions. Some common modes of transmission are mechanical contact, such as through tools, hands, insects or plant debris; seed transmission, such as through infected seeds or pollen; and vector transmission, such as through aphids, whiteflies or thrips.
The period of disease onset for tobacco virus disease depends on the virus species, the host plant, the inoculum dose and the environmental conditions. Generally, the symptoms appear within a few days to a few weeks after infection. The environmental conditions required for tobacco virus disease also depend on the virus species and the host plant. Generally, the disease is favored by high temperature, high humidity, high light intensity and low soil fertility.
The overwintering method of tobacco virus disease varies depending on the virus species and the region. Some common methods are surviving in perennial weeds, such as horsenettle or ground cherry; surviving in alternative hosts, such as tomato or pepper; and surviving in infected seeds or plant debris.
в‘ Medication for aphid control. Before planting tobacco, aphids on nearby nightshade crops and weeds should be sprayed with insecticide to prevent winged aphids from migrating and spreading the virus. Within 40 days after planting tobacco, a yellow trap should be used to lure aphids for prediction. If winged aphids are found in the dish, they can be immediately sprayed in the field for prevention and control. In addition, the combination of tobacco planting can effectively control the number of aphids in the tobacco field and prevent the spread of virus diseases in the field Spray 1000 times "Tianda 2116" (specialized for leafy vegetables and tobacco "Tianda 2116")+1500 times Tianda Yufeng solution, or 1000 times "Tianda 2116"+1000 times 50% fungicide solution, once every 10-15 days, continuously spraying 3-4 times. Not only can it enhance the disease resistance of tobacco plants and prevent the occurrence of viral diseases, but it can also increase tobacco yield by about 20% and improve tobacco quality. It is specially used for the use of Aolike tobacco virus. Each bag of 40g is mixed with 15 kg of water, and the whole plant is evenly sprayed with no water dripping.
Infected plants or plant parts should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent further spread of the virus. Tools, equipment and hands should be washed or disinfected after handling infected plants to avoid mechanical transmission. Seeds should be treated with hot water or acid to eliminate seed-borne viruses. 1 2
Some natural enemies, such as predators, parasitoids and pathogens, can help reduce the population of insect vectors that transmit the viruses. For example, ladybugs, lacewings, hoverflies and parasitic wasps can feed on or parasitize aphids and whiteflies. Some fungi, bacteria and viruses can also infect and kill insect vectors. 3 4
Crop rotation, intercropping, mulching, weed control and irrigation management can help reduce the incidence and severity of tobacco virus disease. Crop rotation can break the life cycle of the virus and its vector by planting non-host crops for at least two years. Intercropping can diversify the cropping system and provide a barrier for virus transmission. Mulching can suppress weed growth and conserve soil moisture. Weed control can eliminate alternative hosts for the virus and its vector. Irrigation management can avoid water stress and excess moisture that can favor virus infection and vector activity.
["Mosaic: Irregular patches of light green, yellow or white on the leaves, giving a mosaic-like appearance.", "Mottling: Blotches or spots of different shades of green on the leaves.", "Distortion: Abnormal growth or shape of the leaves, stems or flowers, such as curling, crinkling, twisting or stunting.", "Necrosis: Death of plant tissues, resulting in brown or black spots or lesions on the leaves, stems or flowers.", "Wilting: Loss of turgor pressure in plant cells, causing drooping or collapsing of the leaves or stems.", "Chlorosis: Loss of chlorophyll in plant cells, causing yellowing or whitening of the leaves or stems."]
["Virus particles: The presence of virus particles in plant sap or tissues can be observed by electron microscopy or immunological assays.", "Inclusion bodies: The presence of abnormal structures in plant cells that are formed by virus replication or accumulation can be observed by light microscopy or histochemical staining.", "Vector presence: The presence of insect vectors that carry the virus can be observed by visual inspection or trapping methods."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not applicable, as tobacco virus disease is caused by viruses, not fungi. However, some tobacco plants have resistance genes that can recognize and respond to viral infection, such as the N gene that confers resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The mechanism of resistance involves the N protein, which is a nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) protein that can bind to the TMV helicase domain and trigger a hypersensitive response (HR) that limits the virus spread. 1 2 3 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is also not applicable, as tobacco virus disease is caused by viruses, not bacteria. However, some methods can be used to detect viral infection in tobacco plants, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or immunocapture reverse transcription PCR (IC-RT-PCR). These methods can use specific antibodies or primers to identify viral antigens or nucleic acids in plant sap or tissues. 4 5 
Entry: The virus enters the plant cell through mechanical wounds or insect vectors that pierce the cell wall and membrane. Uncoating: The virus releases its RNA genome from its protein coat inside the cytoplasm or nucleus of the plant cell. Replication: The virus replicates its RNA genome using viral or host enzymes and produces more copies of viral RNA. Translation: The virus translates its RNA genome into viral proteins using host ribosomes and produces more viral components. Assembly: The virus assembles its RNA genome and viral proteins into new virus particles inside the plant cell. Movement: The virus moves from cell to cell through plasmodesmata or from tissue to tissue through phloem or xylem. Egress: The virus exits the plant cell through mechanical wounds or insect vectors that feed on the infected plant. 
Suppressors of RNA silencing: These are viral proteins that interfere with the host's defense mechanism of RNA silencing, which involves degrading viral RNA by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs). For example, TMV p19 protein binds to siRNAs and prevents their incorporation into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Suppressors of cell death: These are viral proteins that inhibit the host's defense mechanism of programmed cell death (PCD), which involves killing infected cells by apoptosis or HR. For example, TMV p50 protein interacts with host SGT1 protein and disrupts its function in PCD signaling. Manipulators of host metabolism: These are viral proteins that alter the host's metabolic pathways to favor viral replication or movement. For example, TMV 126 kDa protein activates host callose synthase and increases callose deposition at plasmodesmata, which facilitates virus movement between cells. Viral coat proteins: These are viral proteins that form the outer layer of the virus particle and protect the viral genome. They can be targeted by antibodies or antiviral drugs that can block their binding to host receptors or interfere with their assembly or disassembly. Viral replicase proteins: These are viral proteins that catalyze the synthesis of viral RNA from viral RNA templates. They can be targeted by inhibitors or mutagens that can reduce their activity or fidelity. Viral movement proteins: These are viral proteins that facilitate the transport of virus particles across cell walls or vascular tissues. They can be targeted by blockers or disruptors that can prevent their interaction.
