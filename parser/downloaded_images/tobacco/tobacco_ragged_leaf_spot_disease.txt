Tobacco is a cash crop that is grown for its leaves, which are used for making cigarettes, cigars, and other products1. Tobacco ragged leaf spot disease can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as fungal, bacterial, or viral agents1 2. Some examples of fungal pathogens are Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria alternata, which cause target spot and brown spot, respectively1 3. Some examples of bacterial pathogens are Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas campestris, which cause angular leaf spot and bacterial leaf spot, respectively2. Some examples of viral pathogens are tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and tobacco etch virus (TEV), which cause mosaic and etch symptoms, respectively2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease depends on the species. For example, Rhizoctonia solani reproduces by forming sclerotia, which are hard masses of hyphae that can survive in the soil1. Alternaria alternata reproduces by forming conidia, which are asexual spores that can be dispersed by wind or water3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease also depends on the species. For example, Rhizoctonia solani infects the lower leaves of tobacco plants by releasing basidiospores from the soil surface onto the foliage4. The disease spreads upward as the spores germinate and colonize the host tissue. The disease is favored by warm and humid conditions1. Alternaria alternata infects the mature leaves of tobacco plants by producing conidia on crop debris or other hosts3. The disease spreads to newer leaves by wind or water splashing. The disease is favored by warm and moist conditions, especially during periods of drought stress3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the species. For example, Rhizoctonia solani typically causes symptoms around June when the weather is warm and humid1. Alternaria alternata typically causes symptoms later in the season when the plants are more mature and stressed3. The environmental conditions required for the disease depend on the species. For example, Rhizoctonia solani prefers temperatures above 24Г‚В°C (75Г‚В°F) and relative humidity above 98%1. Alternaria alternata prefers temperatures between 25Г‚В°C (77Г‚В°F) and 30Г‚В°C (86Г‚В°F) and relative humidity above 90%3.
The overwintering method of this disease depends on the species. For example, Rhizoctonia solani overwinters as sclerotia in the soil or on crop debris1. Alternaria alternata overwinters as conidia in the soil or on crop debris or other hosts3.

such as roguing (removing and destroying the infected plants), sanitizing (disinfecting the tools, equipment, and hands that contact the plants), and barrier cropping (planting non-host plants around the tobacco field to block the virus vectors)1.
such as using beneficial insects (such as ladybugs, lacewings, and predatory mites) or microbial antagonists (such as Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens) to suppress or kill the virus vectors (such as aphids, thrips, and whiteflies)1.
such as using resistant varieties (such as NC 925 or K 326), crop rotation (avoiding planting tobacco after other susceptible crops), weed management (eliminating the alternative hosts of the virus), and fertilization (avoiding excessive nitrogen that can increase the susceptibility of the plants)1.

["The disease signs of this disease vary depending on the type of pathogen that causes it. For fungal pathogens, such as Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria alternata, the disease signs are the fungal structures that can be observed on the infected tissues. For example, Rhizoctonia solani produces hyphae and sclerotia, which are visible as white or brown threads or masses on the underside of the leaves or on the stems. Alternaria alternata produces conidia, which are visible as dark brown or black dots or rings within the lesions. The fungal structures can be seen with a hand lens or a microscope. For bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas campestris, the disease signs are the bacterial exudates that can be observed on the infected tissues. The bacterial exudates are sticky or slimy substances that ooze out of the lesions when they are wet. The bacterial exudates can be seen with the naked eye or a hand lens. They may dry up into crusts or streaks on the leaves. For viral pathogens, such as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and tobacco etch virus (TEV), the disease signs are not visible on the infected tissues. The viral particles are too small to be seen with a microscope. The only way to detect them is by using special techniques, such as serological tests or molecular tests."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the species and the strain. For example, Rhizoctonia solani has been reported to develop resistance to some fungicides, such as benomyl, carbendazim, and thiophanate-methyl1 2. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the ГЋВІ-tubulin gene that reduce the binding affinity of the fungicides1 2. The level of resistance can be measured by the effective concentration (EC50) of the fungicide that inhibits 50% of the fungal growth1 2. Alternaria alternata has also been reported to develop resistance to some fungicides, such as azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and kresoxim-methyl3 4. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the cytochrome b gene that reduce the sensitivity to the fungicides3 4. The level of resistance can be measured by the EC50 of the fungicide that inhibits 50% of the fungal spore germination3 4. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is the bacterial streaming test. This test involves cutting a small piece of infected tissue and placing it in a drop of water on a microscope slide. The slide is then observed under a microscope for the presence of bacterial cells streaming out of the tissue. The bacterial streaming test can help confirm the diagnosis of bacterial leaf spot caused by Pseudomonas syringae or Xanthomonas campestris. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease depends on the type of pathogen that causes it. For fungal pathogens, such as Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria alternata, the mechanism involves penetrating the host tissue by producing appressoria (specialized infection structures) or by direct hyphal growth1 3. The fungi then colonize the intercellular spaces or invade the cells, causing cell death and tissue necrosis1 3. The fungi also produce various pathogenic effectors, such as enzymes, toxins, and secondary metabolites, that facilitate infection and suppress host defence1 3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the fungal species and strain. For example, Rhizoctonia solani produces cellulases, pectinases, proteases, glucanases, oxalic acid, and necrosis-inducing proteins1. Alternaria alternata produces polygalacturonases, cutinases, lipases, catalases, alternariol, alternariol monomethyl ether, tenuazonic acid, and host-specific toxins3. The fungi may also show differences in infestation of different plants depending on their host range and specificity. For example, Rhizoctonia solani has over 200 known hosts and is classified into different anastomosis groups (AGs) based on hyphal anastomosis reactions and host preference1. AG-2-2 and AG-3 are the main groups that infect tobacco plants1. Alternaria alternata has a wide host range and can infect many crops, but wounding is often required for disease development3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well known. However, some studies have identified some genes that are essential for bacterial survival or virulence on tobacco plants. For example, a study by Wang et al. (2016) used transposon mutagenesis to screen for knockout lethal genes in Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, which causes angular leaf spot on tobacco. They found 303 genes that were essential for bacterial growth on minimal medium or tobacco leaves. Some examples of these genes are involved in DNA replication, transcription, translation, cell wall biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, iron uptake, and stress response. Another study by Li et al. (2018) used RNA interference (RNAi) to screen for virulence genes in Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which causes bacterial leaf spot on tobacco. They found 18 genes that were required for bacterial pathogenicity on tobacco leaves. Some examples of these genes are involved in type III secretion system, flagellar biosynthesis, quorum sensing, and oxidative stress response.
