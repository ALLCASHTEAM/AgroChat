The type of crop of this plant is cultivated tobacco, which is an annually grown herbaceous plant of the Nicotiana genus1. The type of disease of this disease is bacterial, caused by Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes)2 3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is not applicable, since it is not a fungal disease. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are not clear, but it may be related to breaks in the skin barrier due to insect bites, ulcers and chronic skin conditions, current or prior injury, nasopharyngeal infection, venous disease and lymphoedema, and immune deficiency or compromise2 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually abrupt, and often accompanied by fevers, chills and shivering2 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are not well defined, but it may be more prevalent in humid and warm climates3.
The overwintering method of this disease is not known, but it may persist in the soil or on plant debris3.
Chemical control involves the use of antibiotics, such as penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, or flucloxacillin, either orally or intravenously, depending on the severity of the infection1 2.
Physical measures involve the elevation of the affected part to reduce swelling and pain, and the removal of any necrotic tissue to prevent further infection2.
Prophylactic measures involve the prevention of skin breaks that can allow the entry of bacteria, such as by washing hands, treating skin conditions, using moisturizers, avoiding scratching, and promptly treating any wounds1 2 3.

["This disease are pain, redness, and rash on the skin, usually with a well-demarcated raised border.", "The rash may be bright red, firm, swollen, blistered, or necrotic.", "The infection may also cause fever, chills, shivering, fatigue, headache, vomiting, and malaise1 2 3."]
["This disease are the presence of streptococcal bacteria on the skin or in the blood.", "This can be detected by a physical examination, a blood culture, or a skin biopsy1 2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not applicable, since it is not a fungal disease. The resistance of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease, namely Streptococcus pyogenes, may involve the production of virulence factors such as M protein, hyaluronic acid capsule, streptolysin O and S, streptokinase, and pyrogenic exotoxins1 2. These factors may help the bacteria to evade host immune responses, damage host tissues, and cause systemic effects1 2. The type of resistance agent may vary depending on the antibiotic used, but some common mechanisms include enzymatic inactivation, target modification, efflux pumps, and resistance genes3 . The level of resistance may depend on the geographic location, the antibiotic class, and the bacterial strain3 . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is the rapid antigen detection test (RADT), which can identify group A streptococci from a throat swab within minutes by using antibodies that react with a carbohydrate antigen on the bacterial cell wall . This test has a high specificity but a variable sensitivity, so a negative result may need to be confirmed by a throat culture . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the entry of bacteria through skin breaks caused by trauma, insect bites, ulcers, or other skin conditions1 2. The bacteria then multiply and spread in the dermis and subcutaneous tissues, causing inflammation and tissue damage1 2. The bacteria may also produce toxins that can cause systemic effects such as fever, rash, shock, and organ failure1 2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the bacterial strain and the host immune status1 2. The differences in infestation of different plants are not well studied, but some factors that may influence susceptibility include plant species, cultivar, age, health, and environmental conditions. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease may include genes that encode for virulence factors or genes that are essential for bacterial survival. For example, some potential targets are emm genes that encode for M protein variants, has genes that encode for hyaluronic acid capsule synthesis, slo gene that encodes for streptolysin O production, sag genes that encode for streptolysin S production, ska gene that encodes for streptokinase production, and spe genes that encode for pyrogenic exotoxins1 2. Knockout of these genes may reduce bacterial virulence or viability.
