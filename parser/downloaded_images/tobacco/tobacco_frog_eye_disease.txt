Tobacco is a cash crop that is grown for its leaves, which are used for making cigarettes, cigars, and other products1 2. Tobacco frog eye disease is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Cercospora nicotianae3 1 4 2 5 6.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced on conidiophores1 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are not very clear, but it seems that the disease is favored by warm and humid conditions, and the conidia can be dispersed by wind, rain, or insects7 2 6.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually in the mature stage of the tobacco plant, when the lower and middle leaves are affected first, and then the disease can spread to the upper leaves3 1 2 5. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30В°C) and high humidity (80-90%)2. The disease can also be influenced by the soil conditions, such as pH, fertility, and moisture6.
The overwintering method of this disease is not well documented, but it is possible that the fungus can survive on infected plant debris or alternative hosts, such as weeds or other solanaceous crops1 4 6.
Some fungicides that have been reported to be effective against Cercospora nicotianae are Bordeaux mixture, Verdasan, Tillex, Coprantol, Karathane, Dithane M 45, Azoxystrobin, Propiconazole, Kresoxim methyl, and Pyraclostrobin + Metiram1 2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications may vary depending on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may also depend on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the pathogen4 3.
Some physical measures that can help reduce the disease are cutting off the infected parts of the plant and destroying the infected plant debris to prevent the spread of the fungus4 3.
Some biological agents that have been reported to have antagonistic activity against Cercospora nicotianae are Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, and Pseudomonas fluorescens3. These agents can be applied as bio-fungicides or bio-primers to enhance the plant resistance3.
Some agricultural practices that can help prevent or manage the disease are crop rotation, weed control, avoiding overhead irrigation, maintaining optimal soil pH and fertility, and using resistant cultivars4 3 .
["Small, circular or irregular, sunken, brown patches on the lower and middle leaves of the plant5 4 1 2 3 .", "White centers and dark brown margins of the patches, resembling frog eyes5 4 1 2 3 .", "Yellow halos around the patches on green leaves4.", "Coalescence of patches causing drying and withering of leaves5 2."]
["Tiny black dots on two sides of the patches, which are the fruiting bodies (stroma) of the fungus1.", "Long, thin, curved, brown spores (conidia) emerging from the stroma on conidiophores4 1."]
The mechanism of resistance may involve the production of cercosporin, a photosensitizing toxin that can damage plant cells and tissues1 2. The type of resistance agent may depend on the fungicide used, but some examples are demethylation inhibitors (DMI), quinone outside inhibitors (QoI), and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHI)1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the environmental conditions, the pathogen population, and the host genotype1. 
I do not have a quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease, because this disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium3 1 2 4 . 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but some studies have suggested that the fungus may use scopoletin, a phenolic compound, as a signal molecule to induce plant defense responses and increase its virulence2 . The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host susceptibility, resistance, and tolerance to the fungus3 1 4 . 
I do not have the potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease, because this disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium3 1 2 4 .
