The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop1. The type of disease of this disease is a fungal disease2 3 caused by the fungus Guignardia bidwellii2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is a conidium, which is a type of asexual spore2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are airborne, as the spores are dispersed by wind and rain4 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease is spring, when new shoots and leaves emerge2 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is mummified berries, which remain on the vine or fall to the ground and serve as sources of inoculum for the next season2 3.
With fungicides such as copper, sulfur, mancozeb, or chlorothalonil applied before and during rainy periods1 2 3.
Such as removing and destroying infected leaves and pruning to improve air circulation1 2 3.
With antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis or Pseudomonas fluorescens applied to the foliage4.
Such as planting resistant cultivars, avoiding overhead irrigation, and maintaining balanced soil fertility1 2 3.
["bright yellow spots on the upper surface of leaves that turn brown and necrotic with time1 2 3.", "white fluffy growth on the lower surface of the spots that contain spores1 2 3.", "premature leaf drop in severe cases1 2 3.", "The disease can also affect shoots, tendrils, inflorescences, and berries, causing brown lesions, wilting, and rotting1 2 3."]
["Sporangia and zoospores of the fungus Plasmopara viticola that are produced on the lower surface of the leaf spots1 2 3.", "Sporangia are sac-like structures that contain zoospores, which are motile spores that can swim in water.", "The sporangia and zoospores are visible as white fluffy growth under a magnifying lens or microscope1 2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some possible factors that may affect resistance are the grape species, the cultivar, and the use of fungicides or silicon1 2 3 4 5 6. In general, native American grapes are more resistant to leaf blight than European grapes4 5, and some cultivars have been bred for resistance or tolerance1 2. Fungicides such as copper, sulfur, mancozeb, or chlorothalonil can provide effective control of leaf blight if applied preventively and regularly1 2 3. Silicon can also enhance the plant's defense against the fungus and strengthen the cell walls6. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not available, but a possible way to identify the fungus is by sending a sample of infected leaves to a diagnostic laboratory1 2. The laboratory can use microscopic examination or molecular techniques to confirm the presence of the fungus Plasmopara viticola and rule out other pathogens that cause similar symptoms. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is by penetrating the host tissues with zoospores1 2 3. The fungus produces two types of spores: sporangia and zoospores. Sporangia are sac-like structures that contain zoospores, which are motile spores that can swim in water. The sporangia are released from overwintering structures called oospores in spring during wet weather. The zoospores are dispersed by rain splash and wind to susceptible tissues. The zoospores germinate and penetrate the host cuticle in the presence of moisture and warm temperatures. The infection causes tissue necrosis and reduced photosynthesis. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not known, as this disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium1 2 3. Therefore, I do not have this information.
