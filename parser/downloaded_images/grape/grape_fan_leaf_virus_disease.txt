The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop, as grapevines are grown for their fruits that are used for various purposes such as wine making, juice production, table grapes, raisins, etc.1 The type of disease of this disease is a viral disease, caused by the Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), a member of the nepovirus group.1 2
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic virus of this disease is not a fungus, but a nucleic acid that replicates inside the host cells using the host machinery.2 The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease is nematodeborne, as the virus is transmitted via a dagger nematode vector, Xiphinema index, that acquires the virus through feeding on roots of an infected plant, and passes it on in the same manner.1 2
The period of disease onset for this disease is early spring, when the symptoms develop and persist through the vegetative season.1 The environmental conditions required for the disease are not well defined, but some factors that may influence the disease severity are soil type, soil moisture, soil temperature, and plant age.3
The overwintering method of this disease is through the nematode vector that survives in the soil and can carry the virus for several years.1

Growers should plant certified, disease-free plants. Pruning tools should be disinfected with a bleach solution (1 part household bleach, 9 parts water) between cuts. Infected plants should be removed and discarded.1

some grapevine varieties have shown resistance to the virus, such as Riesling, which carries a single recessive factor named rgflv1 that confers resistance to GFLV.1 The mechanism of resistance is unknown, but it is putatively distinct from the virus susceptibility factors already described in plants.1 
some methods to detect the virus in plant tissues are based on molecular or serological techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunocapture RT-PCR (IC-RT-PCR), etc.2 1 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is through the infection of grapevine cells by GFLV, which is transmitted by X. index nematodes that feed on the roots. The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cells and moves systemically through the phloem to infect all parts of the plant.3 1 The virus has two genomic RNAs that encode four proteins: a replication protein (P1), a movement protein (P2), and two capsid proteins (P3 and P4). The capsid proteins form icosahedral particles that protect the viral genome and mediate host recognition and attachment.3 4 The virus can infect different grapevine species and cultivars, but some are more susceptible than others.3 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are again not applicable, as the disease is caused by a virus, not a bacteria. However, some potential targets of the virus are the host factors that are involved in virus susceptibility or resistance, such as receptors, transporters, regulators, etc. These factors are not well characterized in grapevine, but some studies have suggested that they may include eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs), RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs), RNA silencing components, etc.3 4
