Grapes are a type of horticultural crop, which means they are grown for their fruits, flowers, or ornamental value1. Black pox disease of grapes is a fungal disease, caused by the fungus Guignardia bidwellii2 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in small black structures called pycnidia2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by warm, wet weather in the spring and summer, which favors the release and dispersal of spores by rain, wind, or insects4. The spores can infect all green parts of the vine, especially young leaves and fruits2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the stage of plant growth. The first symptoms on leaves can appear in late spring, about 8 to 25 days after infection2. The fruit infection can occur shortly after flowering, when the berries are half to almost full size2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (above 20Г‚В°C) and high humidity (above 90%) for at least 12 hours5. The disease also prefers acidic soil conditions5.
The overwintering method of this disease is by mummified berries that remain on the vine or fall to the ground, where they produce perithecia, which are sexual fruiting bodies that produce ascospores in the spring2.
Chemical control: Fungicides such as copper, sulfur, mancozeb, captan, or myclobutanil can be applied to protect the foliage and fruit from infection. The first spray should be applied when the shoots are 10 to 15 cm long and repeated at 10 to 14 day intervals until the berries begin to color1. The application dose, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product label and the weather conditions.
Physical measures: Infected leaves, shoots, tendrils, and mummified fruits should be removed and destroyed to reduce the source of inoculum. Pruning and training can also improve air circulation and sunlight penetration in the canopy, which can reduce the humidity and favor the drying of plant surfaces1 2.
Biological control: There are no effective biological agents for controlling black pox disease of grapes. However, some natural enemies of the fungus, such as Trichoderma spp., may have some antagonistic effects3.
Agricultural control: Planting resistant or tolerant grape varieties can reduce the severity of the disease. Some examples of resistant varieties are Concord, Delaware, Niagara, Catawba, and Fredonia1. Avoiding overhead irrigation and excessive fertilization can also help prevent favorable conditions for the fungus2.
["Reddish brown and circular to angular spots on the upper surface of the leaves starting in late spring. As spots merge, they form irregular, reddish brown blotches. The center of the leaf spot turns tannish brown and is surrounded by a black margin. Black, speck-sized fruiting bodies (pycnidia) are arranged in a definite ring just inside the margin of the lesion1 2.", "Small spots on the green berries that become circular and whitish tan, often surrounded by a brown ring. The spots grow rapidly and may cover half of the berry within 48 hours. Within a few days the entire berry becomes coal black, hard, and mummified. The surface of the withered fruit is soon covered with minute, black, pimple-like pycnidia that are arranged in circular zones1 2."]
["The presence of pycnidia on the infected leaves and fruits. Pycnidia are small, black, flask-shaped structures that produce conidia (asexual spores) that can infect new tissues during wet weather1 2.", "The presence of perithecia on the mummified fruits that overwinter on the ground or on the vines. Perithecia are black, spherical structures that produce ascospores (sexual spores) that are ejected into the air during rain and infect young leaves and fruits in spring1 2.", "I do not have enough information to answer this question. I could not find any reliable sources on the resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease, such as the mechanism of resistance, the type of resistance agent, and the level of resistance, etc.", "A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to examine the infected tissues under a microscope and look for the presence of pycnidia or perithecia, which are the fruiting structures of the fungus4. Another method is to use a DNA-based assay that can detect the fungal DNA in plant samples5.", "The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is by spore germination and penetration of the plant tissues. The fungus produces two types of spores: conidia and ascospores. Conidia are asexual spores that are produced in pycnidia and can infect new tissues throughout the season during wet weather. Ascospores are sexual spores that are produced in perithecia and are released in spring after rain. Both types of spores can infect all green parts of the vine, especially young leaves and fruits6. The fungus may use some pathogenic effectors to manipulate the plant defense responses, but I could not find any specific information on this topic."]
