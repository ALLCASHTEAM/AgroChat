The type of crop of grape is a horticultural crop1, which is a type of crop that is grown for its fruits, flowers, or ornamental value. The type of disease of black rot is a fungal disease2 3, which is a type of disease that is caused by a fungus that infects the plant tissues.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of black rot is by ascospores and conidia2 3, which are spores that are produced in specialized structures called perithecia and pycnidia. The ascospores are sexual spores that are released during spring rains, while the conidia are asexual spores that are produced throughout the growing season. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of black rot are by rain splash and wind4 3, which are the main agents that disperse the spores from the overwintering structures or infected plant parts to the susceptible tissues. The spores germinate and penetrate the host cuticle in the presence of moisture and warm temperatures.
The period of disease onset for black rot is during the early stages of plant development2 3, especially between bud break and four weeks after bloom. This is when the young leaves, shoots, and fruits are most vulnerable to infection. The symptoms become visible after 8 to 25 days of infection. The environmental conditions required for black rot are wet and warm weather2 3, which favor the growth and reproduction of the fungus. The disease is also more severe on plants that are stressed by poor growing conditions2 3, such as excessive nitrogen fertilization, inadequate irrigation, or improper pruning.
The overwintering method of black rot is by surviving on infected plant tissues2 3, especially mummies (dried-up fruits) and lesions (dark spots) on canes, spurs, cordons, or trunks. These tissues contain perithecia or pycnidia that produce spores for the next season.
Fungicides such as mancozeb, captan, myclobutanil, or azoxystrobin can be applied to the plants to protect them from infection or reduce disease severity. The type of fungicide, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect depend on the product label, the disease risk, and the crop stage1 2.
Sanitation can help reduce the inoculum of the fungus by removing or burning the infected plant debris after harvest1 2. Pruning or cutting off the infected parts may help improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plant1 2.
No effective biological control agents have been reported for this disease1 2.
Crop rotation with non-host crops can reduce the inoculum of the fungus in the soil1 2. Tillage can also help bury the infected residue and expose it to decomposition1 2. Planting date can be adjusted to avoid the periods of high disease risk, such as cool and wet weather1 2. Irrigation management can reduce the duration of leaf wetness and humidity by avoiding overhead watering or scheduling irrigation for early morning1 2.
["Brown circular lesions on leaves, shoots, tendrils, and stems. The lesions may have a black border and a tan center with tiny black dots (pycnidia).", "The lesions may coalesce and cause large areas of dead tissue on the plant tissues. On fruits, symptoms appear as small brown spots that enlarge and turn black.", "The infected fruits shrivel and dry up into hard black mummies that remain attached to the cluster1 3 4."]
["Black pycnidia of the fungus that are produced within the lesions on the plant tissues.", "The pycnidia contain conidia (asexual spores) that are oval or cylindrical and have one or two cross-walls.", "The conidia are visible with a hand lens or microscope1 3 4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some possible factors that may affect resistance are the cultivar, the berry size, and the ripening time1 2 3 4 5. In general, Vitis vinifera cultivars are highly susceptible to black rot, while some hybrids and other Vitis species are less susceptible1 3. Cultivars with large, juicy berries are more susceptible than those with small, firm berries4 5. Cultivars that ripen late in the season are less affected than those that ripen early2 4. However, no cultivar is completely resistant to black rot3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not available, but a possible way to identify the fungus is by observing the characteristic symptoms on leaves, shoots, and fruits1 2 3. On leaves, the fungus causes small, brown circular lesions with dark margins and black dots (pycnidia) in the center1 2. On shoots, the fungus causes elongated brown lesions with pycnidia1 2. On fruits, the fungus causes small brown spots that enlarge and turn black, causing the berries to shrivel and dry into mummies with pycnidia on the surface1 2 3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is by penetrating the host tissues with spores1 2 3. The fungus produces two types of spores: ascospores and conidia. Ascospores are sexual spores that are released from perithecia (fruiting structures) in spring during wet weather. Conidia are asexual spores that are produced in pycnidia throughout the growing season. Both types of spores are dispersed by rain splash and wind to susceptible tissues. The spores germinate and penetrate the host cuticle in the presence of moisture and warm temperatures. The infection causes tissue necrosis and reduced plant vigor. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not known, as this disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium1 2 3. Therefore, I do not have this information.
