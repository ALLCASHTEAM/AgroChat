The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop, as grape is grown for its edible fruits that are used for fresh consumption, wine making, juice production, and other purposes1 2. The type of disease of this disease is a fungal disease, caused by the fungi Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium spp.3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is a conidium, which is a type of asexual spore that is produced in structures called pycnidia or perithecia3 4. The conidia are dispersed by rain splash or wind and infect pruning wounds or natural cracks on the grapevine tissues3 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are wounddependent, as the fungus requires an entry point to colonize the grapevine wood3 4. The disease is more prevalent in older vines (&gt;10 years) and in regions with wet winters and hot summers3 4. The disease can also be transmitted by infected propagation material3 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease is variable, as the symptoms may not appear for several years after infection or may be inconsistent from year to year3 4. The symptoms may occur at any time during the growing season, but are more common during July and August3 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool and moist conditions for spore production and infection, and hot and dry conditions for symptom expression3 4. The optimal temperature range for infection is 15-25В°C (59-77В°F), while the optimal temperature range for symptom expression is 25-35В°C (77-95В°F)3 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is survival in infected wood, as the fungus can persist in the grapevine xylem (water-conducting tissue) for many years without causing symptoms3 4. The fungus can also produce resting structures called chlamydospores that can survive in adverse conditions3 4.
chemical control with fungicides such as thiophanate-methyl, tebuconazole, or flusilazole applied to pruning wounds1 2.
physical measures such as cutting off the infected parts and removing them from the vineyard1 2.
biological control with antagonistic microorganisms such as Trichoderma spp. or Bacillus spp. applied to pruning wounds1 2.
agricultural control such as avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, maintaining balanced irrigation, and delaying pruning until late winter or early spring1 2.
["Interveinal striping on leaves that start out as dark red in red cultivars and yellow in white cultivars, and then dry and become necrotic3 1 2.", "Small, round, dark spots on berries that are each bordered by a brown-purple ring1 2.", "Sudden dieback of the entire shoot or adjacent shoots in a severe form of the disease known as "apoplexy"2."]
["Concentric rings of dark spots in cross-sectional cuts through canes, spurs, cordons, or trunks from which symptomatic shoots originate1 2.", "perithecia or pycnidia embedded in diseased woody parts of vines that produce spores2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is low, as the fungus can be controlled by fungicides and cultural practices1 2. The mechanism of resistance is not well understood, but it may involve detoxification of fungicides, modification of target sites, or reduced uptake of fungicides3. The type of resistance agent is fungicide, which can be applied to the pruning wounds or to the shoots and leaves1 2. The level of resistance is variable, as different strains of the fungus may have different sensitivities to fungicides3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is molecular detection, which can use PCR or LAMP techniques to identify the DNA of the fungus from wood or leaf samples . Another method is visual inspection, which can detect the characteristic symptoms of striping on leaves and spots on fruits1 2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is colonization of grapevine wood, which leads to disruption of water transport and production of phytotoxic compounds1 2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, as there is no evidence of a direct interaction between the fungus and the plant cells1 2. However, some studies have suggested that the fungus may produce enzymes that degrade the plant cell wall or metabolites that interfere with the plant physiology1 2. The differences in infestation of different plants are related to their genetic susceptibility and environmental conditions, as some grape varieties have genes that confer resistance to the fungus or trigger defense responses, and some climates favor disease development more than others1 2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not applicable, as grape black measles is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium. However, some potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are genes involved in water transport, as the fungus blocks the xylem vessels and reduces water flow in the plant1 2, or genes involved in stress response, as the fungus induces oxidative stress and cell death in the plant1 2.
