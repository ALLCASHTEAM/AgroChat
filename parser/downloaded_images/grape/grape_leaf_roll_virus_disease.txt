The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop1, as grapes are grown for their fruits and not for their seeds or fibers. The type of disease of this disease is a viral disease2 3 4, as it is caused by a complex of vector-borne virus species in the family Closteroviridae, such as Grapevine Leafroll-Associated Viruses (GLRaVs).
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic virus of this disease is not a fungus, but a virus. Therefore, it does not produce conidia, mobile spores or other fungal structures. Instead, it replicates inside the host cells using their genetic material and machinery3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are mainly through vegetative propagation and grafting of infected plant material, as well as through insect vectors, such as mealybugs and soft scales, that can transmit the virus between vines and nearby vineyard blocks5 3 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the grape variety, the weather, the soil, and the cultivation practices. However, some general patterns are that symptoms are more evident in late summer and fall, especially after veraison (the onset of ripening), and that symptoms are more severe in red-skinned varieties than in white-skinned varieties1 2 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are not well understood, but some factors that may influence the severity and spread of the disease are temperature, humidity, sunlight exposure, irrigation, fertilization, pruning, and canopy management1 3 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is through latent infection in the grapevine tissues, such as roots, stems, leaves, and buds. The virus can remain dormant in the plant until favorable conditions trigger its replication and movement within the plant3 4.
Planting healthy stock that is certified to be free of leafroll virus and other viruses. This is the primary defense against grape leafroll disease.
Removing and destroying virus-infected vines as soon as they are detected. Top-grafting is not advisable, as rootstocks may be infected.
Disinfecting pruning tools with bleach or other agents to prevent spreading the virus between vines.
Monitoring and controlling insect vectors, such as mealybugs and soft scales, that can transmit the virus between vines and nearby vineyard blocks. Chemical control of these pests may help limit the spread of the disease within a vineyard.
["Leaf tissue between the veins turns deep red to purple in red-skinned varieties, or yellow in white-skinned varieties, with downward curling or cupping of the leaf margins. The veins remain green.", "Reduced vigor and growth of the vines, and increased susceptibility to winter injury due to reduced carbohydrate stores.", "Yield losses of 30-50%, delayed and uneven ripening of fruit, reduction in brix and berry color, and increase in titratable acids.", "Poor quality and taste of the grapes due to disrupted balance between acidity and sugar."]
["Serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), that use antibodies to recognize specific antigens of the virus.", "Molecular tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), that use primers to amplify specific regions of the viral genome.", "Biological tests, such as grafting or inoculation of indicator plants that show characteristic symptoms when infected by the virus."]
