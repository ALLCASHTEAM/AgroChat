Grape is a horticultural crop1 that belongs to the flowering plant genus Vitis1 2. Grape can be affected by various types of diseases, such as fungal, bacterial, viral, oomycete or physiological diseases3. Some examples of grape diseases are downy mildew (oomycete), Pierce's disease (bacterial), powdery mildew (fungal), and grapevine leafroll disease (viral)3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of grape disease depends on the type of fungus. For example, the fungus that causes powdery mildew reproduces by conidia, while the fungus that causes botrytis bunch rot reproduces by spores. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of grape disease also depend on the type of disease. For example, downy mildew is transmitted by airborne spores that require wet conditions to infect, while Pierce's disease is transmitted by insect vectors such as sharpshooters and spittlebugs that feed on xylem sap.
The period of disease onset for grape disease varies depending on the type of disease and the environmental conditions. For example, downy mildew can occur from bud break to harvest, but is most severe during periods of high humidity and rainfall, while Pierce's disease can occur anytime during the growing season, but is most noticeable during late summer and fall when symptoms become more evident. The environmental conditions required for grape disease are different for each type of disease. For example, powdery mildew thrives in warm and dry conditions with high humidity, while botrytis bunch rot favors cool and moist conditions with poor air circulation.
The overwintering method of grape disease depends on the type of pathogen. For example, the oomycete that causes downy mildew overwinters as oospores in fallen leaves and soil, while the bacterium that causes Pierce's disease overwinters in insect vectors or infected vines.
Avoid applying any additional stress to the vines, such as pruning, fertilizing, or irrigating excessively.
Monitor the vines for signs of recovery, such as new growth, bud break, or fruit set.
If the damage is severe and widespread, consider replanting or grafting new vines.
If the damage is localized and mild, prune out the affected parts and wait for regrowth.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the type of fungus and the herbicide used. For example, some fungi can degrade herbicides by producing enzymes that break down their active ingredients1. Others can develop mutations that alter their sensitivity to herbicides2. The type of resistance agent can be a gene, a protein, or a metabolite that confers resistance to the fungus. The level of resistance can vary from low to high depending on the dose and frequency of herbicide exposure2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use molecular techniques such as PCR, DNA hybridization, or DNA sequencing to detect the presence and identity of the fungus in plant samples1. These methods are fast, sensitive, and specific, but they require specialized equipment and expertise. Alternatively, some fungi can be identified by their morphological characteristics such as spore shape, size, color, and arrangement1. These methods are simpler and cheaper, but they may not be accurate or reliable for some fungi. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the interaction between the fungus and the plant host at different levels. The fungus has to overcome the physical and chemical barriers of the plant surface, such as cuticle, wax, and antimicrobial compounds1. Then, it has to penetrate the plant cell wall and membrane by using mechanical force or enzymatic degradation1. Once inside the cell, it has to evade or suppress the plant defense responses, such as oxidative burst, hypersensitive reaction, and systemic acquired resistance1. The fungus also has to obtain nutrients and reproduce inside the plant tissue by using various strategies such as biotrophy, necrotrophy, or hemibiotrophy1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors that the fungus produces depend on its lifestyle and host range. Effectors are molecules that manipulate the host physiology and immunity to facilitate infection and colonization2. Some examples of effectors are toxins, enzymes, elicitors, suppressors, and mimics2. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility between the fungus and the plant genotype. Some plants may have resistance genes that recognize specific fungal effectors and trigger defense responses2. Some fungi may have avirulence genes that encode effectors that are recognized by plant resistance genes and limit infection2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are genes or proteins that are essential for the survival or virulence of the bacteria. For example, knockout lethal genes are genes that cause death or loss of function when mutated or deleted3. These genes can be identified by using techniques such as transposon mutagenesis or CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing3. Some examples of knockout lethal genes in phytopathogenic bacteria are those involved in DNA replication, cell division, cell wall synthesis, metabolism, and secretion systems3.
