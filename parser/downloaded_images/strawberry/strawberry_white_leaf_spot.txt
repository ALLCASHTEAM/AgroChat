Strawberry is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruits1. Strawberry snake-eye disease is a fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum acutatum2.
The pathogenic fungus of this disease reproduces by conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind, water, or insects2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions, and the conidia can infect strawberry leaves through wounds or natural openings3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the cultivar, the inoculum level, and the environmental conditions. The disease can appear at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during the flowering and fruiting stages2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris or on alternative hosts such as weeds or other crops2.
Fungicides such as captan, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and fenhexamid can be applied during bloom and fruit development to prevent or reduce fruit infection by Colletotrichum acutatum1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease pressure. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the pathogen.
Infected plant parts such as leaves, stems, and fruits should be removed and destroyed to reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease1 3.
There are some biological agents that can antagonize or suppress the growth of Colletotrichum acutatum, such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, and Pseudomonas fluorescens3. These agents can be applied as foliar sprays or soil drenches to enhance the plant's defense against the pathogen3.
Cultural practices such as crop rotation, weed management, mulching, pruning, and irrigation management can help reduce the disease incidence and severity1 3. Crop rotation with non-host crops can break the disease cycle and reduce the inoculum level in the soil3. Weed management can eliminate alternative hosts and improve air circulation in the field3. Mulching can prevent soil splash and fruit contact with the soil1. Pruning can improve light penetration and reduce humidity in the canopy3. Irrigation management can avoid wetting the foliage and creating favorable conditions for the pathogen1.
["On leaves: Small, circular, water-soaked spots that enlarge and become brown or purple with gray or tan centers. The spots may coalesce and cause leaf blight or defoliation1 3.", "On stems: Dark brown to black lesions that girdle the stem and cause wilting or dieback of the plant1 3.", "On fruits: Small, sunken, brown spots that expand and become dark purple or black with orange spore masses. The infected fruits may become hard, dry, and mummified1 3."]
["The presence of orange spore masses (conidia) on the surface of infected fruits, which are visible to the naked eye or under a magnifying lens1 3.", "The presence of salmon-colored spore masses (acervuli) on infected leaves or stems, which are visible under a microscope1 3."]
