Strawberry is a type of horticultural crop, which means it is grown for its edible fruits or flowers1. Strawberry brown spot disease can be caused by different types of fungal diseases, such as leaf spot, leaf blotch, verticillium wilt, red stele, charcoal rot, leaf scorch, alternaria fruit spot, phomopsis leaf blight, anthracnose and leather rot1 2 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease depends on the specific type of fungus. For example, leaf spot is caused by Mycosphaerella fragariae, which produces conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or rain1. Leather rot is caused by Phytophthora cactorum, which produces oospores (sexual spores) that can survive in the soil for several years3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease also depends on the specific type of fungus. For example, leaf spot is more prevalent in cool and wet conditions, and can be transmitted by infected plant debris, tools or nursery stock4. Leather rot is more prevalent in warm and wet conditions, and can be transmitted by soil splash, irrigation water or infected fruit3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the type of fungus and the environmental conditions. For example, leaf spot can appear at any stage of plant growth, but is more common during flowering and fruiting1. Leather rot can appear at any stage of fruit development, but is more severe on green or white fruit3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are generally favorable for fungal growth and infection, such as high humidity, moisture, temperature and soil pH. For example, leaf spot thrives in temperatures between 15В°C and 25В°C, and a relative humidity above 90%1. Leather rot thrives in temperatures above 20В°C, and a soil pH below 5.53.
The overwintering method of this disease depends on the type of fungus and its survival structures. For example, leaf spot can overwinter as conidia or mycelium on infected plant debris or weeds1. Leather rot can overwinter as oospores in the soil or on infected plant material3.
Applying fungicides that are effective against the specific fungus, such as Switch Г‚В® 62.5 WG (fludioxonil + cyprodinil) or Thiram SC (thiram) for Neopestalotiopsis fruit rot1, or Captan 50 WP (captan) or Rovral 4 F (iprodione) for leather rot2. The application dose, period, number and effect may vary depending on the product label and the disease severity.
Removing and destroying infected plant debris, fruits and weeds that can harbor the fungus. Avoiding overhead irrigation or splashing water that can spread the fungus. Pruning or mowing the plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity2 3 4.
Using beneficial microorganisms that can suppress or compete with the fungus, such as Trichoderma spp., Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., or Streptomyces spp. These can be applied as biofungicides or incorporated into the soil3.
Choosing resistant or tolerant cultivars of strawberry that can withstand the fungus. Rotating crops with non-host plants that can break the disease cycle. Planting in well-drained soil with optimal pH and fertility. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization that can promote fungal growth2 3 4.
["Leaf spot: Purple or gray patches on the leaves that turn brown and dry out. The patches may have light-colored centers or reddish-purple borders. The leaves may curl, wilt or drop off3 4.", "Leather rot: Brown spots on the fruits that make them tough and inedible. The spots may have a water-soaked appearance or a white halo. The fruits may also have a bitter or sour taste2 4.", "Anthracnose fruit rot: Brown circular spots on the fruits that decompose them. The spots may have salmon-colored spores on them. The fungus may also infect the crown, stems and leaves of the plant3 4."]
["Leaf spot: Conidia (asexual spores) of Mycosphaerella fragariae that are oval, hyaline and multicellular, visible under a microscope3.", "Leather rot: Oospores (sexual spores) of Phytophthora cactorum that are spherical, thick-walled and dark brown, visible under a microscope2.", "Anthracnose fruit rot: Acervuli (fruiting bodies) of Colletotrichum acutatum that are black, cushion-like and produce orange masses of conidia, visible with a hand lens3."]
Leaf spot: The fungus Mycosphaerella fragariae has shown resistance to some fungicides that inhibit sterol biosynthesis, such as fenarimol and myclobutanil1. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the target enzyme (CYP51) that reduce the binding affinity of the fungicide1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal strain and the fungicide dose1. Leather rot: The fungus Phytophthora cactorum has shown resistance to some fungicides that inhibit mitochondrial respiration, such as metalaxyl and mefenoxam2. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the target gene (cytochrome b) that prevent the fungicide from interfering with electron transport2. The level of resistance may depend on the fungal population and the fungicide concentration2. 
Leaf spot: Observing the conidia (asexual spores) of Mycosphaerella fragariae under a microscope. The conidia are oval, hyaline and multicellular, and can be collected from infected leaves or cultured on potato dextrose agar1. Leather rot: Observing the oospores (sexual spores) of Phytophthora cactorum under a microscope. The oospores are spherical, thick-walled and dark brown, and can be extracted from infected fruits or soil3. 
Leaf spot: The fungus Mycosphaerella fragariae produces conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or rain and land on strawberry leaves. The conidia germinate and penetrate the leaf tissue through stomata or wounds. The fungus grows inside the leaf cells and causes necrotic spots. The fungus also produces pseudothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) that release ascospores (sexual spores) that can infect new leaves or plants1. Leather rot: The fungus Phytophthora cactorum produces oospores (sexual spores) that can survive in the soil for several years. The oospores germinate and produce zoospores (motile spores) that swim in water and infect strawberry fruits or roots. The fungus grows inside the fruit tissue and causes brown spots and rotting. The fungus also produces sporangia (asexual fruiting bodies) that release more zoospores that can spread the infection3. 
Leaf spot: Genes involved in sterol biosynthesis, such as CYP51, that are essential for fungal growth and viability, and are inhibited by some fungicides1. Leather rot: Genes involved in mitochondrial respiration, such as cytochrome b, that are essential for fungal energy production and survival, and are inhibited by some fungicides2.
