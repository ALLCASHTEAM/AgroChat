Strawberry is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruits1. Strawberry leaf scorch is a fungal disease that is caused by the fungus Diplocarpon earliana1 2.
The fungus reproduces by producing conidia (asexual spores) and ascospores (sexual spores) that are dispersed by wind and rain2. The disease is transmitted by airborne and rainsplashed spores that infect the leaves, petioles, runners, fruit stalks, fruit and caps of strawberry plants2 3.
The disease occurs throughout the growing season, but is more severe in late summer and fall when the weather is warm and humid1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are leaf wetness during warm weather (68-86В°F), and older plantings of susceptible varieties2 4.
The fungus overwinters on the lower leaf surfaces of dead leaves infected in the previous year, and produces ascospores in the spring2.
Apply fungicides such as captan, chlorothalonil, or mancozeb at bloom time and before fruiting to protect the foliage from infection1 2. Follow the label instructions for dosage, application interval, and pre-harvest interval. The effectiveness of chemical control depends on the timing, frequency, and coverage of the fungicide applications3.
Remove and destroy infected leaves and debris, especially after renovation, to eliminate the overwintering source of the fungus1 2. Cut off and dispose of infected runners, fruit stalks, fruit and caps to prevent further spread of the disease4.
There is no known biological control agent for strawberry leaf scorch5.
Use drip irrigation instead of overhead irrigation to avoid wetting the leaves and creating favorable conditions for the fungus1 2. Rotate strawberry crops with non-host crops to reduce the inoculum level in the soil2. Use certified disease-free transplants and choose resistant varieties such as 'Allstar', 'Earliglow', 'Honeoye', 'Jewel', 'Kent', and 'Redchief'2 3. Increase air circulation by proper plant spacing and weed control4.

Mechanism of resistance: The fungus has a high genetic diversity and can adapt to different environmental conditions and host genotypes1. It can also produce different types of spores that have different levels of resistance to environmental stresses and fungicides2. Type of resistance agent: The fungus can develop resistance to fungicides that have a single-site mode of action, such as benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, and strobilurins3 4. It can also detoxify some fungicides by producing enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases5. Level of resistance: The level of resistance depends on the fungicide group, the fungal population, and the frequency and intensity of fungicide applications3 4. Resistance can be qualitative (complete or high) or quantitative (partial or low) depending on the fungicide group and the mutation involved. 
Visual inspection: Examine the leaves for symptoms and signs of the disease, such as purplish-brown spots, black fruiting bodies, and dark apothecia. Use a hand lens or a microscope to observe the spore morphology and septation. Molecular detection: Use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to amplify and detect specific DNA sequences of the fungus from infected plant tissue. Use specific primers and probes to differentiate the fungus from other closely related species. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus produces various pathogenic effectors that can manipulate host defense responses, such as secreted proteins, secondary metabolites, and small RNAs. The number and diversity of these effectors are not well known, but some examples are: Necrosis-inducing protein 1 (NIP1): A secreted protein that induces cell death and chlorosis in susceptible cultivars by binding to a plasma membrane receptor-like kinase. Botrydial: A secondary metabolite that inhibits host oxidative burst and cell wall reinforcement by interfering with NADPH oxidase activity and callose deposition. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs): Small RNAs that can silence host genes involved in defense responses by inducing RNA interference (RNAi) in the host cells. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus can infect different plants within the Rosaceae family, such as strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, rose, and apple. However, the degree and severity of infestation may vary depending on the host genotype, cultivar susceptibility, environmental conditions, and fungal strain. 
Knockout lethal genes: There is no known phytopathogenic bacteria that causes strawberry leaf scorch. The disease is caused by a fungus, Diplocarpon earliana. However, some potential targets for controlling fungal pathogens are genes that are essential for fungal growth, development, pathogenicity, or survival. Some examples are: Calcineurin: A calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase that regulates various cellular processes such as hyphal growth, stress responses, virulence factors, and antifungal resistance. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK): A protein kinase that mediates signal transduction pathways involved in fungal development, differentiation, stress adaptation, and pathogenicity. Histone deacetylase (HDAC): An enzyme that removes acetyl groups from histone proteins and modulates chromatin structure and gene expression. HDACs play important roles in fungal morphogenesis, virulence, stress responses, and antifungal resistance.
