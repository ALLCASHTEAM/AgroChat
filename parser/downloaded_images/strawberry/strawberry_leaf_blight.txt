Strawberry is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible fruits1. Strawberry leaf blight is a fungal disease that is caused by the fungus Phomopsis obscurans2 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by pycnidia, which are flask-shaped structures that produce spores called conidia3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The fungus survives overwinter within infested plant debris or within infected plant parts. The pycnidia release conidia that are dispersed by rain splash or wind to infect new leaves or fruits4.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually in the spring or early summer, when new leaves emerge and the weather is warm and humid5. The symptoms are most apparent on older leaves near or after harvest3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperatures (above 25Г‚В°C) and high humidity (above 90%)5. The disease is favored by wet weather and frequent irrigation3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving within infested plant debris or within infected plant parts, such as crowns, petioles, or fruits3.
fungicides such as captan, thiophanate-methyl, azoxystrobin, or pyraclostrobin can be applied to protect the foliage and fruit from infection1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the pathogen1.
removing and destroying infected plant debris or plant parts can reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease1 3. Avoiding overhead irrigation or excessive watering can also reduce the humidity and favor the drying of the foliage1 3.
there are no commercially available biological agents for this disease, but some natural antagonists such as Trichoderma spp. or Bacillus spp. may have some suppressive effect on the pathogen1.
planting resistant or tolerant cultivars can reduce the disease incidence and severity1 4. Some examples of tolerant cultivars are Allstar, Earliglow, Honeoye, Jewel, Kent, and Redchief1. Rotating with non-host crops for at least two years can also reduce the inoculum level in the soil1. Providing adequate spacing, ventilation, and nutrition for the plants can enhance their vigor and resistance to the disease1 3.
["Reddish purple spots 3 вЃ„ 8 вЂќ to 1 вЃ„ 2 вЂќ in diameter that develop on leaflets and eventually enlarge to become V-shaped and delineated by major leaf veins1 4. The enlarged lesions develop a dark brown central zone surrounded by a lighter brown zone. An outer zone of purple, red or yellow can also develop1.", "Entire stems may be killed when petioles and trusses become completely girdled with black to purple, elongate, and sunken lesions1.", "Fruit lesions can be circular and sunken, with a dark brown to black color1. They may be confused with anthracnose fruit rot1.", "Severe defoliation may occur in nursery fields or perennial plantings, resulting in reduced yields and plant quality1 4."]
["Numerous pycnidia (flask-shaped structures that produce spores) that develop in the center of the leaf or fruit spots. They are black and tiny, and may require a hand lens to see them clearly1 4.", "Conidia (spores) that are released from the pycnidia and dispersed by rain splash or wind to infect new leaves or fruits. They are hyaline (transparent), unicellular, and oval-shaped1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some reports suggest that the fungus may have developed resistance to some fungicides, such as benzimidazoles and sterol demethylation inhibitors (DMIs)1. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the target genes or enzymes that reduce the sensitivity or affinity of the fungicide1. The type of resistance agent may depend on the mode of action and the chemical structure of the fungicide1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal population, the fungicide dose, and the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to observe the presence of pycnidia and conidia on the infected plant tissues using a hand lens or a microscope2 3. Pycnidia are black and tiny structures that produce conidia, which are hyaline, unicellular, and oval-shaped spores2 3. These are the signs of the fungus and can help to distinguish it from other pathogens that cause similar symptoms2 3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but it may involve the penetration of the conidia into the plant tissues through natural openings or wounds, and the colonization of the intercellular spaces by hyphae1. The fungus may produce some pathogenic effectors that modulate the plant defense responses or facilitate the infection process1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but they may include enzymes that degrade plant cell walls, toxins that inhibit plant metabolism, or proteins that interact with plant receptors or signaling pathways1. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host specificity, susceptibility, or resistance of the plants to the fungus1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are also unknown, but they may include genes or proteins that are essential for plant growth, development, or immunity1. Knockout lethal genes are genes that cause death or severe defects when they are mutated or deleted1. Some examples of knockout lethal genes in plants are those involved in DNA replication, cell division, photosynthesis, or hormone biosynthesis1.
