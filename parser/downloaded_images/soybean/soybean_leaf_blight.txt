Soybean is a cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1 2. Soybean leaf blight can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as bacteria (bacterial blight and bacterial pustule), fungi (brown spot, frogeye leaf spot and Cercospora leaf blight), and oomycetes (downy mildew)1 2 3 4 5.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of soybean leaf blight depends on the specific fungus. For example, Cercospora sojina, the causal agent of frogeye leaf spot, produces conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or rain3. Cercospora kikuchii, the causal agent of Cercospora leaf blight, also produces conidia, but can also form ascospores (sexual spores) in infected seeds5. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of soybean leaf blight also depend on the specific pathogen. For example, bacterial blight and bacterial pustule are transmitted by wind or splashing water droplets from plant residue or infected plants to the leaves6 2 4. Brown spot and frogeye leaf spot are transmitted by wind or rain-splashed conidia from infected leaves or plant debris1 2 3. Downy mildew is transmitted by wind-borne oospores from infected plants or soil1 2. Cercospora leaf blight is transmitted by wind-borne conidia or ascospores from infected leaves or seeds5.
The period of disease onset for soybean leaf blight varies depending on the pathogen and the environmental conditions. For example, bacterial blight and bacterial pustule typically occur in the early season, while brown spot, frogeye leaf spot, downy mildew and Cercospora leaf blight tend to occur in the late season during pod-filling stages1 2 3 4 5. The environmental conditions required for soybean leaf blight also vary depending on the pathogen. For example, bacterial blight is favored by cool and rainy weather, while bacterial pustule can develop in a wide range of temperatures but requires high humidity1 2 4. Brown spot is favored by warm and wet weather, while frogeye leaf spot is favored by warm temperatures, humid conditions and frequent rains1 2 3. Downy mildew is favored by cool and moist weather, while Cercospora leaf blight is favored by hot and humid weather1 2 3 5.
The overwintering method of soybean leaf blight depends on the pathogen and its survival structures. For example, bacterial blight and bacterial pustule overwinter in plant residue on the field124. Brown spot, frogeye leaf spot and Cercospora leaf blight overwinter in infected leaves or plant debris, while Cercospora leaf blight can also overwinter in infected seeds1235. Downy mildew overwinters in infected plants or soil as oospores12.
This disease is caused by a bacterium and is favored by cool and rainy weather. Control is obtained by planting disease-free seed, rotating crops, and avoiding cultivation during times when the soybean foliage is wet1 2.
This disease is also caused by a bacterium and can develop throughout the growing season whenever wet conditions occur. Control is similar to bacterial blight, but also includes using resistant varieties2.
This disease is caused by a fungus and is favored by warm and wet weather. Control is achieved by using resistant varieties, rotating crops, and applying foliar fungicides if necessary2.
This disease is caused by an oomycete and is favored by cool and moist weather. Control is based on using resistant varieties, planting certified seed, rotating crops, and applying foliar fungicides if needed2.
["Bacterial blight: Small, water-soaked spots that turn yellow and then dark brown to black with a yellow border. The spots often coalesce to form irregular brown patches. Portions of the infected area may fall out, giving the leaves a ragged appearance1 2.", "Bacterial pustule: Small yellow spots with reddish-brown centers that may develop into raised pustules with yellow halos2.", "Brown spot: Small dark brown spots that may or may not have a halo. Brown spots may coalesce and infected leaves may turn yellow, creating leaves that appear golden with brown spots or patches2.", "Downy mildew: Pale green to yellow spots on the upper leaf surface that correspond to grayish-white tufts of fungal growth on the lower leaf surface2.", "Frogeye leaf spot: Small dark spots that enlarge to circular or irregular leaf lesions with gray-brown centers and darker reddish-purple borders. Visible gray fungal growth may be seen on the underside of the lesions2 3.", "Cercospora leaf blight: Reddish-purple to bronze discoloration of the upper leaves that may spread to the entire plant. Infected leaves may curl upward and drop prematurely4 5."]
["Bacterial blight: No visible signs of the bacterium on the plant1 2.", "Bacterial pustule: Raised pustules with yellow halos that contain bacterial ooze2.", "Brown spot: No visible signs of the fungus on the plant2.", "Downy mildew: Grayish-white tufts of fungal growth on the lower leaf surface2.", "Frogeye leaf spot: Gray fungal growth on the underside of the lesions2 3.", "Cercospora leaf blight: No visible signs of the fungus on the plant4 5."]
Septoria glycines: This fungus causes brown spot and can develop resistance to quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides and demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides by mutations in the cytochrome b and cyp51 genes, respectively. Cercospora sojina: This fungus causes frogeye leaf spot and can develop resistance to QoI fungicides by mutations in the cytochrome b gene. Cercospora kikuchii: This fungus causes Cercospora leaf blight and purple seed stain and can develop resistance to QoI fungicides by mutations in the cytochrome b gene. Cercospora cf. flagellaris and Cercospora cf. sigesbeckiae: These fungi are closely related to Cercospora kikuchii and also cause Cercospora leaf blight and purple seed stain. They can also develop resistance to QoI fungicides by mutations in the cytochrome b gene. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the DNA of the fungus from infected plant tissue or seed samples. These methods can identify the specific species of Cercospora or Septoria that cause leaf blight symptoms on soybeans . 
Septoria glycines: This fungus produces spores that are dispersed by wind or rain splash to infect soybean leaves through natural openings or wounds. The fungus grows inside the leaf tissue and produces toxins that cause necrotic lesions. The fungus also produces more spores that emerge from the lesions and infect new leaves or plants. Cercospora sojina: This fungus produces spores that are dispersed by wind or rain splash to infect soybean leaves through natural openings or wounds. The fungus grows inside the leaf tissue and produces toxins that cause necrotic lesions with chlorotic halos. The fungus also produces more spores that emerge from the lesions and infect new leaves or plants. Cercospora kikuchii: This fungus produces spores that are dispersed by wind or rain splash to infect soybean leaves through natural openings or wounds. The fungus grows inside the leaf tissue and produces toxins that cause reddish-purple to bronze discoloration of the leaves. The fungus also infects soybean seeds and causes purple seed stain. The fungus can survive on infected plant residue or seeds and infect new plants in the next season. Cercospora cf. flagellaris and Cercospora cf. sigesbeckiae: These fungi are closely related to Cercospora kikuchii and have similar mechanisms of infestation, except that they produce different types of toxins that cause different symptoms on soybean leaves and seeds.
