Soybean is a cash crop that is grown for its oil and protein content1. Streptomycosis is a bacterial disease caused by <em>Streptomyces scabies</em>2.
The pathogenic bacterium of streptomycosis reproduces by spore formation3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of streptomycosis are not well understood, but it is believed that the disease is soilborne and can be spread by contaminated seeds, tools, or machinery2 4.
The period of disease onset for streptomycosis is usually late in the growing season, when the soybean plants are mature or senescing2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high soil moisture and low soil pH2 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is the survival of spores in the soil or on plant debris2 4.
Chemical control involves applying copper-based bactericides or antibiotics such as streptomycin or oxytetracycline to the seeds or foliage1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity.
The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the bacterial strain1.
Physical measures include cutting off infected parts and destroying infected plant debris to reduce inoculum sources2. 0
Agricultural control involves using disease-free seeds, rotating with non-host crops, avoiding mechanical injury to the plants, and improving soil drainage and pH2 3.
["The lesions may be sunken, cracked, or corky, and may girdle the stems or petioles, causing wilting or death of the plant parts2 3.", "The lesions may also reduce seed quality and germination2."]
["The ooze may dry up and form crusts on the lesion surface2 3.", "The presence of the bacterium can be confirmed by laboratory tests such as isolation, microscopy, biochemical assays, or molecular techniques2 3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some reports suggest that it may have multiple mechanisms of resistance to different fungicides, such as efflux pumps, target site mutations, and detoxification enzymes1 2. The type of resistance agent may depend on the mode of action of the fungicide, such as demethylation inhibitors (DMIs), quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), or succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs)1 2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal strain, the fungicide dose, and the environmental conditions1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) that can detect the presence of <em>Alternaria</em> spp. antigens in plant samples within minutes3. The LFI is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive technique that uses a strip coated with antibodies that bind to specific antigens and produce a color change3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the production of spores by the fungus that is dispersed by wind or rain and land on the plant surface4. The spores germinate and penetrate the plant tissue through natural openings or wounds and cause infection4. The fungus produces various toxins and enzymes that damage the plant cells and cause necrotic lesions4. The fungus can also produce secondary metabolites that modulate the plant defense responses and enhance its virulence5. The infestation of different plants may depend on the host specificity and susceptibility of the fungus and the plant, respectively4 5. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are not well known, but some studies have identified some genes that are involved in its pathogenicity or survival. For example, a gene encoding a transcription factor called AaBrlA was found to be essential for spore formation, toxin production, and virulence of <em>Alternaria alternata</em>. Another gene encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase called AaCYP51 was found to be involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and resistance to DMIs. A gene encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase called AaHOG1 was found to be important for osmotic stress tolerance and virulence of <em>Alternaria alternata</em>.
