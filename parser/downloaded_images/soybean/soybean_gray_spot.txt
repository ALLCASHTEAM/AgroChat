Soybean is a type of cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1. Soybean gray spot is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi2 3, which is also known as soybean rust2 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing urediniospores, which are non-mobile spores that can be dispersed by wind or rain2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and wind4 3. The disease can spread rapidly when there are frequent rain events and warm temperatures2 3. The disease can also be transmitted by infected plant material, such as seeds, leaves or stems2 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the soybean cultivar2 3. The disease can occur at any stage of soybean development, but it is more common after flowering, beginning on lower leaves2 3. The disease can cause significant yield losses if it infects the plants during the pod-filling stage2 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm temperatures (between 15В°C and 28В°C), high humidity (above 75%) and wet leaves (at least six hours of leaf wetness per day)2 3. The disease can also survive in a wide range of soil conditions, such as acidic, neutral or alkaline soils2 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on alternative hosts, such as kudzu, clover, vetch or other legumes that can serve as reservoirs for the fungus2 3. The fungus can also overwinter on infected soybean debris in tropical or subtropical regions where there is no frost2 3.
According to one source1, fungicides such as azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin and tebuconazole can be used to control soybean gray spot disease. The application dose, period, number and effect may vary depending on the product label, disease severity and environmental conditions. For example, azoxystrobin can be applied at a rate of 6-12 fl oz/A at R3-R4 stage with a maximum of two applications per season.
One possible physical measure is to cut off the infected parts of the plant and dispose of them properly to prevent further spread of the disease. However, this may not be feasible or effective in large-scale production.
There is no information on biological control of soybean gray spot disease available on the web.
Some agricultural practices that may help reduce the risk of soybean gray spot disease are crop rotation, planting resistant varieties, avoiding planting soybeans in low-lying or poorly drained areas, and avoiding excessive irrigation or fertilization.
["Soybean gray spot disease causes circular to irregular leaf lesions that are 1/8-1/4 inch in diameter with gray to brown centers and reddish purple margins2. The lesions may coalesce and cause blighting of leaves (Figure 1). Visible gray fungal growth may be seen on the underside of the lesions3. The disease may also affect stems, branches and pods, causing black to gray spots, blotches and streaks4."]
["The disease signs of soybean gray spot disease are the physical evidence of the pathogen itself on the plant. The pathogen that causes soybean gray spot disease is a fungus called Cercospora sojina3. The fungus produces spores that are dispersed by wind or rain splash and infect new plants. The spores can be seen as gray fungal growth on the underside of the leaf lesions3. The spores can also be detected by microscopic examination or molecular techniques."]
Mechanism of resistance: The phytopathogenic fungus of soybean gray spot disease, Cercospora sojina, can develop resistance to fungicides by mutations in target genes or increased expression of efflux pumps1. For example, mutations in the cytochrome b gene can confer resistance to QoI fungicides, and mutations in the CYP51 gene can confer resistance to DMI fungicides1. Type of resistance agent: The type of resistance agent refers to the class of fungicides that the fungus is resistant to. According to one source1, C. sojina has been reported to be resistant to QoI (quinone outside inhibitor), DMI (demethylation inhibitor), and MBC (methyl benzimidazole carbamate) fungicides in some regions of the United States. Level of resistance: The level of resistance refers to the degree of sensitivity reduction of the fungus to a fungicide. This can be measured by the EC<sub>50</sub> value, which is the effective concentration of a fungicide that inhibits 50% of fungal growth. The higher the EC<sub>50</sub> value, the higher the level of resistance. According to one source1, C. sojina isolates from Mississippi had EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.01 to 3.6 Вµg/ml for azoxystrobin (a QoI fungicide), from 0.01 to 0.8 Вµg/ml for tebuconazole (a DMI fungicide), and from 0.01 to &gt;100 Вµg/ml for thiophanate-methyl (an MBC fungicide). 
One possible quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of soybean gray spot disease is to use a lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) device that can detect fungal spores from infected plant tissue or air samples2. LFA devices are similar to pregnancy tests and can provide results within minutes. The device consists of a strip with a sample pad, a conjugate pad, a test line, and a control line. The sample pad contains antibodies that bind to fungal spores. The conjugate pad contains gold nanoparticles that are conjugated with another antibody that also binds to fungal spores. When a sample is applied to the device, the spores are captured by both antibodies and form a sandwich complex that migrates along the strip by capillary action. When the complex reaches the test line, it produces a visible signal (usually a red line) that indicates a positive result. The control line serves as an internal quality check and should always produce a signal regardless of the sample. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: Pathogenic effectors are molecules secreted by pathogens that manipulate host cells and tissues to facilitate infection and colonization3. C. sojina produces several types of pathogenic effectors, such as toxins, hydrolytic enzymes, and small secreted proteins (SSPs)3. For example, cercosporin is a toxin that generates reactive oxygen species and causes oxidative damage to host cells3. Hydrolytic enzymes such as cellulases, pectinases, and proteases degrade plant cell walls and proteins and release nutrients for fungal growth3. SSPs are proteins with unknown functions that may modulate host immunity or metabolism3. According to one source3, C. sojina has 1,029 predicted SSPs in its genome, which is more than other Cercospora species. Differences in infestation of different plants: C. sojina is a host-specific pathogen that only infects soybean plants4. However, within soybean plants, C. sojina may show differences in infestation depending on the plant genotype and phenotype4. For example, some soybean varieties have partial or complete resistance to C. sojina and may restrict lesion growth or fungal colonization4. Some soybean phenotypes such as leaf pubescence or waxiness may also affect fungal attachment or penetration4. 
Using RNA-seq technology to analyze the transcriptomes of strong and weak virulence strains of gray spot fungus, we aim to discover the interaction-specific biological pathways and virulence-related differentially expressed genes of the two virulence-different strains under nitrogen starvation conditions, and then understand the reasons for their virulence changes and infection mechanisms5.
