Soybean is a type of cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil. 1 2 Soybean rust is a type of fungal disease that is caused by two species of rust fungi, Phakopsora pachyrhizi and Phakopsora meibomiae. 2 3
The pathogenic fungus of soybean rust reproduces by producing spores that are released from pustules on the infected plant tissue. The spores are either urediniospores, which can infect the same host plant repeatedly, or teliospores, which can germinate to produce basidiospores, which can infect alternate hosts such as legumes. 3 The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of soybean rust are influenced by several factors, such as the availability of host plants, the environmental conditions, and the wind currents. The disease can spread quickly and cause leaf spots and defoliation of soybean plants. The spores are dispersed by wind over long distances and can infect new plants when they land on wet leaves. The disease can also be transmitted by insects that carry spores on their bodies or mouthparts. 4 3
The period of disease onset for soybean rust depends on the timing of spore arrival, the stage of soybean development, and the weather conditions. The disease can occur at any stage of soybean development, but is most common in or after the plants begin flowering and pods start developing in the middle of the growing season. Plants are most susceptible during reproductive stages. The disease can develop within 7 to 10 days after infection under favorable conditions. 1 3 The environmental conditions required for the disease are moderate temperatures (59Г‚В°F to 85Г‚В°F), high humidity (over 75%), and extended periods of wet weather. These conditions favor spore germination, infection, and sporulation. The disease is less likely to occur under hot, dry, or cold conditions. 1 3
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on living plant tissue in the southern states and Mexico, where there are perennial or winter annual hosts for the fungus. The fungus cannot survive on dead plant debris or in the soil. The spores must be transported northward each growing season from areas in the south where the fungus overwinters. 1 3
Fungicides are the main tool for managing soybean rust. Only a few fungicides are labeled for use against soybean rust and they need to be applied upon early infection, covering the entire canopy of the plant. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product and the disease situation. Your local extension office can help you determine which fungicides might be useful and how to apply them correctly. 1 2
Cutting off infected parts of the plant is not recommended as it may spread spores and increase the risk of infection. Burning or burying infected plant debris after harvest may help reduce the inoculum source for the next season.
There are no effective biological control agents available for soybean rust at this time. Some studies have reported that certain bacteria or fungi may have antagonistic effects on the rust fungus, but more research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety.
Cultural practices have little effect on the disease, as the spores can travel long distances by wind and infect new plants regardless of crop rotation, tillage, or planting date. However, some practices may help reduce the disease severity or delay its onset, such as planting resistant varieties (if available), planting early maturing varieties (to avoid late season infection), avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization (to reduce plant susceptibility), and increasing row spacing and plant height (to improve air circulation and reduce leaf wetness). 1
["Yellow mosaic discoloration on the upper surfaces of older foliage at the early stage of infection.", "Tan or reddish-brown lesions (spots) on the underside of leaves, which may also appear on pods and stems. The lesions may be angular to circular in shape, starting as small as a pinpoint and growing together to kill large areas of leaf tissue. 1", "Leaf yellowing and premature defoliation as the disease progresses. 1"]
["Small pustules (blisters) that develop in the lesions and break open to release masses of tan spores. The pustules are most pronounced and numerous on the underside of leaves, but may also occur on other plant parts. The pustules are cone-shaped and can be seen with a 20X hand lens. 1"]
The phytopathogenic fungus of soybean rust is Phakopsora pachyrhizi, also known as Asian soybean rust1. It is an aggressive pathogen that can cause severe yield losses of soybeans2 1. The mechanism of resistance of this fungus is not fully understood, but it involves the ability to overcome the host plant's defense responses and to adapt to different environmental conditions. The type of resistance agent that can be used against this fungus is fungicide, which can protect the plants from infection or reduce the disease severity. The level of resistance of this fungus depends on several factors, such as the fungal genotype, the host genotype, the fungicide type and application, and the environmental conditions . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of soybean rust is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect the fungal DNA in plant samples. This method is fast, sensitive, and specific, but it requires specialized equipment and trained personnel. Another quick test method is lateral flow immunoassay (LFI), which can detect the fungal antigens in plant samples using a paper strip coated with antibodies. This method is simple, cheap, and portable, but it may have lower sensitivity and specificity than PCR. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of soybean rust is complex and involves multiple steps. The fungus produces urediniospores, which are wind-dispersed and land on the host plant's leaves. The spores germinate and penetrate the leaf surface through stomata or wounds. The fungus then forms haustoria, which are specialized structures that invade the plant cells and extract nutrients from them. The fungus also secretes effectors, which are molecules that modulate the plant's defense responses and facilitate the infection process. The type and number of effectors produced by the fungus vary depending on the fungal genotype and the host genotype. Some effectors can trigger a hypersensitive response (HR) in resistant plants, which leads to cell death and limits the fungal growth. Other effectors can suppress or evade the plant's defense responses and enhance the fungal virulence. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility between the fungal effectors and the plant resistance genes.
