Soybean is a legume crop that can be used for various purposes, such as food, feed, oil, biodiesel, and industrial products1. Depending on the region and market, soybean can be considered as a cash crop, a horticultural crop, or a staple crop1. Soybean anthracnose is a fungal disease that affects maturing soybean stems and pods2 3. The primary pathogen that causes anthracnose in the Midwest is the fungus Colletotrichum truncatum, but other fungi may also be associated with anthracnose3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing asexual spores called conidia2 3. These spores are dispersed from black fruiting bodies (acervuli) that develop on the external surface of infected tissue2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by warm and moist conditions that favor infection and disease development4 3. The fungus overwinters in infected crop residue and infected seeds, and may be seedborne3. It also has a wide host range that includes alfalfa, ragweed, and velvetleaf3. The disease typically has minimal effects on yield, but it can reduce yields, stands, and seed quality3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the stage of crop development. Plants can be infected at any time during the season, but symptoms often don't appear until plants reach maturity in the upper Midwestern U.S.3. In the field, disease usually is present in patches where defoliation and wilting may be observed2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm (25-30Г‚В°C) and wet (high humidity or rainfall)5 1. These conditions promote spore germination and infection of susceptible tissue5 1. The disease is more severe in fields with poor drainage, high plant density, or excessive nitrogen fertilization5 1.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in infected crop residue and infected seeds2 3. The fungus can persist in the soil for several years and infect subsequent crops of soybean or other hosts5 1.
Fungicides may be applied to infected seeds or to the foliage after flowering begins. However, there are few situations where fungicide applications are profitable for anthracnose1 2. Some fungicides that have been reported to be effective against anthracnose are azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and flutriafol3.
Infected crop debris should be buried or removed from the field to reduce inoculum1 2. Infected pods and seeds should be discarded or treated with fungicides before planting2.
There is limited information on biological control of soybean anthracnose. Some studies have suggested that antagonistic bacteria or fungi may inhibit the growth of Colletotrichum spp., the causal agents of anthracnose3.
Crop rotation with non-legume crops can reduce the inoculum level in the soil1 2. Planting resistant varieties or cultivars can also reduce disease incidence and severity3.

The lesions may be embedded with black fruiting bodies (acervuli) that have tiny spines (setae) that can be seen with a hand lens2 4.", "Brown cankers on petioles that may cause defoliation or wilting1 2.

Mechanism of resistance: The phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum truncatum, the main causal agent of soybean anthracnose, can overcome host resistance by producing various pathogenic effectors that modulate plant immunity and metabolism1. Some of these effectors are secreted proteins that can suppress plant defense responses, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, callose deposition, and salicylic acid (SA) signaling1. Other effectors are small secondary metabolites that can interfere with plant hormone signaling, such as jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), and auxin1. Type of resistance agent: The resistance agents of C. truncatum are mainly pathogenic effectors that can be classified into two types: secreted proteins and secondary metabolites1. Level of resistance: The level of resistance of C. truncatum to soybean varies depending on the host genotype, environmental conditions, and fungal strain2 3. Some studies have reported that C. truncatum can infect soybean cultivars with different levels of resistance, ranging from susceptible to moderately resistant2 3. However, no immune soybean cultivars have been identified so far4. 
One possible quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers that target the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the fungal ribosomal DNA. This method can detect C. truncatum DNA from infected soybean tissue or seed within a few hours with high sensitivity and specificity. Another possible quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using specific primers that target the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene of C. truncatum. This method can amplify C. truncatum DNA from infected soybean tissue or seed within an hour at a constant temperature without the need for a thermal cycler. The LAMP products can be visualized by adding a fluorescent dye or by observing turbidity changes in the reaction tube. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of C. truncatum on soybean involves the production and secretion of various pathogenic effectors that modulate plant immunity and metabolism1. According to a recent comparative genomic analysis, C. truncatum has 1,113 predicted secreted proteins, 19 predicted secondary metabolite gene clusters, and 12 predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) that may act as pathogenic effectors1. Some examples of these effectors are: CtNUDIX1: A secreted protein that can suppress ROS production and callose deposition in soybean cells during infection. CtGAPDH: A secreted protein that can inhibit SA signaling and induce cell death in soybean cells during infection. Colletotric acid: A secondary metabolite that can mimic JA and interfere with JA-ET signaling in soybean cells during infection. Colletotrichumol A: A secondary metabolite that can mimic auxin and interfere with auxin signaling in soybean cells during infection. CtGH12: A CAZyme that can degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides and facilitate fungal penetration and colonization in soybean cells during infection. Differences in infestation of different plants: C. truncatum has a wide host range that includes not only soybean but also other legumes and non-legumes, such as alfalfa, ragweed, velvetleaf, cotton, peanut, sunflower, etc.2 . However, the differences in infestation of different plants by C. truncatum are not well understood. Some studies have suggested that C. truncatum may have different levels of aggressiveness, virulence factors, and
