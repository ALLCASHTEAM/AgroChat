Soybean is a type of cash crop, which means it is grown for sale rather than for personal use1. Soybean can be affected by various types of diseases, such as fungal, bacterial, viral, oomycete or physiological diseases2. One of the most damaging soybean diseases is soybean cyst nematode (SCN), which is caused by a microscopic roundworm3.
The pathogenic fungus of SCN is Heterodera glycines, which reproduces by producing eggs inside a protective cyst that forms on the roots of soybean plants3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of SCN are influenced by several factors, such as crop rotation, soil type, temperature and moisture4. SCN can spread through soil movement, such as by wind, water, tillage equipment, animals or humans3.
The period of disease onset for SCN depends on the environmental conditions and the soybean cultivar3. SCN can infect soybean plants at any stage of growth, but the most severe damage occurs when infection occurs early in the season3. Symptoms of SCN infection include stunted growth, yellowing leaves, reduced nodulation and lower yields3. The environmental conditions required for SCN are optimal when the soil temperature is between 20В°C and 30В°C and the soil moisture is adequate for soybean growth3. SCN can survive in a wide range of soil pH levels, but it prefers slightly acidic soils3.
The overwintering method of SCN is to remain dormant inside the cysts that protect the eggs from freezing temperatures and desiccation3. The cysts can persist in the soil for several years without a host plant3.
According to a study by Iowa State University1, some herbicides that can cause soybean injury are metribuzin, flumioxazin, sulfentrazone, saflufenacil and fomesafen. These herbicides can be applied preemergence or postemergence, depending on the product label and the soybean variety. The application dose, period, number and effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions, weed species and crop stage. The study recommends following the label instructions carefully and using lower rates when possible to reduce the risk of injury.
According to a report by Penn State Extension2, one way to reduce soybean injury from herbicides is to avoid mechanical damage to the crop, such as tillage or cultivation, after herbicide application. Mechanical damage can increase the uptake of herbicides by the crop and exacerbate the symptoms of injury. The report also suggests avoiding spraying herbicides when the crop is under stress from drought, frost, hail or disease.
According to a report by Oklahoma State University3, one of the causes of soybean kernel damage is fungal infection, which can result in pink discoloration of the seeds. The report states that biological control agents, such as Bacillus subtilis and Trichoderma harzianum, can be applied to soybean seeds to reduce fungal growth and improve seed quality. However, the report cautions that biological control agents may not be effective against all fungal pathogens and may interact with other seed treatments.
According to a report by New York Times4, one of the sources of soybean damage is dicamba drift, which occurs when a herbicide called dicamba volatilizes and moves off-target to nearby fields. The report states that dicamba drift can cause cupping, curling and stunting of soybean leaves, as well as reduced yield and quality. The report suggests that agricultural control measures, such as planting dicamba-tolerant soybean varieties, using buffer zones between fields, applying dicamba only when wind speed and direction are favorable, and cleaning spray equipment thoroughly after use, can help prevent or minimize dicamba drift damage.

According to a study by Nature Communications1, the phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which causes white mold disease in soybean and other crops, can detoxify plant glucosinolate hydrolysis products, such as isothiocyanates, via two pathways: conjugation to glutathione and hydrolysis to amines. The latter pathway involves an isothiocyanate hydrolase that is homologous to a bacterial enzyme and converts isothiocyanates into non-toxic compounds. The study suggests that this enzyme confers resistance to S. sclerotiorum against the glucosinolate defense system of Brassicales plants. According to a study by PNAS2, the soybean ГЋВІ-glucan-elicitor-binding protein (GEBP) is a receptor for ГЋВІ-glucan elicitor (GE) from the phytopathogenic fungus Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. glycinea, which causes root rot disease in soybean. The study shows that GEBP is located in the plasma membrane of soybean root cells and mediates the signaling of GE, leading to defense responses such as phytoalexin accumulation. The study also shows that GEBP has a leucine-rich repeat domain that is involved in GE binding and a kinase domain that is involved in signal transduction. According to a study by PubMed3, a nonpathogenic strain of Fusarium oxysporum (S6) produces cyclosporine A, a cyclic peptide with immunosuppressive and antifungal activities. The study shows that cyclosporine A inhibits the growth and sclerotia formation of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, another phytopathogenic fungus that causes white mold disease in soybean and other crops. The study also shows that co-inoculation of soybean plants with S. sclerotiorum and F. oxysporum (S6) increases the survival rate of the plants compared with plants inoculated with S. sclerotiorum alone.

According to a study by Nature Communications1, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infects soybean and other Brassicales plants by producing oxalic acid, which lowers the pH of the plant tissue and activates plant glucosinolates and myrosinases, resulting in the production of toxic isothiocyanates. However, S. sclerotiorum can detoxify these compounds by hydrolyzing them to amines using an isothiocyanate hydrolase enzyme. The study suggests that this enzyme is a pathogenicity factor that enables S. sclerotiorum to overcome the glucosinolate defense system of Brassicales plants. According to a study by PNAS2, Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. glycinea infects soybean roots by releasing ГЋВІ-glucan elicitor (GE) from its cell wall, which binds to the soybean ГЋВІ-glucan-elicitor-binding protein (GEBP) on the plasma membrane of soybean root cells. This binding triggers a signal transduction pathway that leads to defense responses such as phytoalexin accumulation in soybean. The study suggests that GEBP is a receptor for GE and mediates its signaling. Potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of soybean drug damage:
