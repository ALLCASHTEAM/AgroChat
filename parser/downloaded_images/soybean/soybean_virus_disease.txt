Soybean is a cash crop that is grown for its edible oil and protein-rich seeds1. Soybean virus disease is caused by various types of viruses that infect soybean plants and reduce their yield and quality1. Some of the major soybean viruses are Soybean mosaic virus (SMV), Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV), Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Soybean vein necrosis virus (SVNV), and others2 3 4.
Viruses are submicroscopic particles that consist of strands of either DNA or RNA encased in a coat made of protein molecules. They do not have a mode of reproduction by themselves, but rely on invading living plant cells or sometimes insect vectors to replicate their genetic material and produce new virus particles1. Most plant viruses are spread from plant to plant by specific insect vectors that feed on the sap of infected plants and transmit the virus to healthy plants. The insects that most commonly transmit viruses in soybean are the bean leaf beetle, the soybean aphid, other migratory aphid species, and soybean thrips5. Some viruses can also be transmitted through seed at low rates, such as SMV and AMV2 3. Additionally, some viruses can be transmitted by mechanical means, such as tools or equipment that come in contact with infected plant sap2.
The period of disease onset for soybean virus disease depends on the time of infection, the virus strain, and the environmental conditions. Generally, infection at an early stage of plant development results in more severe symptoms and yield losses than infection at a later stage2. Symptoms may appear within a few days or weeks after infection, depending on the virus and the host1. Some viruses may cause latent infections that do not show any symptoms until certain environmental triggers occur2. The environmental conditions required for soybean virus disease vary depending on the virus and the host. However, some general factors that favor viral infection and spread are: high humidity, moderate temperatures, high insect vector populations, presence of alternative hosts (such as weeds or other crops), and stress factors (such as drought, nutrient deficiency, herbicide injury, etc.)1 2.
The overwintering method of soybean virus disease depends on the virus and the region. Some viruses can survive in infected seed and germinate in the next season, such as SMV and AMV2 3. Some viruses can overwinter in perennial or biennial weeds or crops that serve as alternative hosts, such as alfalfa, clover, or wild legumes for AMV3. Some viruses can overwinter in insect vectors that hibernate in plant debris or soil, such as bean leaf beetle for BPMV1.
Applying insecticides to reduce the populations of insect vectors, such as bean leaf beetle and soybean aphid, can help limit the spread of some viruses, such as BPMV and SMV. However, the timing and frequency of insecticide applications are critical and may not provide consistent or reliable control of the virus1 2. Additionally, insecticides may have negative impacts on beneficial insects and the environment3.
Removing and destroying infected plants or plant parts can reduce the source of inoculum and prevent further infection. However, this method is labor-intensive and may not be feasible for large-scale production3.
Using natural enemies or antagonists of insect vectors or viruses can potentially reduce the incidence and severity of soybean virus disease. For example, some fungal pathogens can infect and kill insect vectors, such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae for bean leaf beetle4. Some plant extracts or compounds can also inhibit viral replication or interfere with viral movement within the plant, such as chitosan, salicylic acid, and ribavirin5. However, more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these biological agents3.
Adopting good agronomic practices can enhance the health and resistance of soybean plants and reduce the risk of viral infection. Some of these practices include: using virus-free seed; rotating crops with non-hosts; planting early to avoid peak vector activity; planting resistant or tolerant cultivars; avoiding mechanical transmission by sanitizing tools and equipment; controlling weeds and alternative hosts; and avoiding stress factors (such as drought, nutrient deficiency, herbicide injury, etc.)1 2 3 .
["Leaf mottling and mosaic: Virus-infected leaves may show a mosaic of light and dark areas of green or yellow. This symptom is typical for SMV, BPMV, AMV, SVNV, and other viruses1 2 . Bumpy, rough leaves (rugose): Some viruses can cause young leaves to have a raised, blistered or distorted appearance. This symptom is common for BPMV and SMV1 2. Seed coat mottling, bleeding hilum, discoloration: Some viruses can affect the seed quality and appearance by causing mottled patterns, dark spots or streaks on the seed coat or hilum (the point where the seed attaches to the pod). This symptom is associated with BPMV, SMV, AMV, TRV, and TSV1 2 .", "Plant stunting: Some viruses can reduce the plant growth and development by interfering with photosynthesis and other metabolic processes. This symptom is often seen in plants infected with SMV, BPMV, AMV,"]
["After being infected by the virus, plants develop multiple systemic diseases, exhibiting symptoms such as mottling, mosaic (mosaic), yellowing, dwarfism, deformity, and clumping. A few have characteristic symptoms such as vein bands, ring spots, erosion marks, and ear protrusions. The disease-resistant host exhibits localized necrotic lesions."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not clear from the web sources I found. However, some studies have suggested that resistance to soybean mosaic virus (SMV), one of the most common and widespread viral pathogens of soybean, is controlled by multiple genes in soybean cultivars and that different strains of SMV may interact differently with these genes1 . Some resistance agents that have been reported to reduce SMV infection include antiviral proteins, such as ribosome-inactivating proteins and chitinases, and RNA interference, which can target viral RNA for degradation. The level of resistance may vary depending on the environmental conditions, the stage of plant development, and the presence of other pathogens. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is also not readily available from the web sources I found. However, some methods that have been used to detect and identify SMV and other soybean viruses include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies to bind to viral antigens, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which amplifies viral DNA or RNA using specific primers, and high-throughput sequencing, which can reveal the viral genome and diversity. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease may depend on the type of virus and its mode of transmission. For example, SMV is transmitted through seed at rates ranging from 0 to 5% in some commercial varieties, and by several species of aphids, including soybean aphid1. The virus enters the plant cells through plasmodesmata, which are channels that connect adjacent cells, and replicates in the cytoplasm using its own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The virus then moves from cell to cell through plasmodesmata and from organ to organ through the phloem, which is the vascular tissue that transports sugars and other substances. The virus can produce several pathogenic effectors, such as helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro), nuclear inclusion protein a (NIa), and coat protein (CP), which can interfere with plant defense responses, such as RNA silencing, salicylic acid signaling, and programmed cell death. The infestation of different plants may depend on their susceptibility or resistance to the virus strain, as well as their genetic diversity and environmental factors. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well understood from the web sources I found. However, some studies have suggested that some genes or proteins in soybean may be involved in conferring resistance or susceptibility to SMV or other viruses. For example, Rsv1 and Rsv3 are two major genes that confer resistance to different strains of SMV by inducing hypersensitive response or systemic acquired resistance. Glyma.15G227500 is a gene that encodes a receptor-like kinase that may be associated with susceptibility to SMV by facilitating viral entry or movement. GmSNAP18 is a gene that encodes a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein that may be involved in SMV infection by regulating vesicle trafficking or membrane fusion. These genes or proteins may be potential targets for genetic engineering or breeding to improve soybean resistance to viral diseases.
