Soybean is a cash crop that is grown for its oil and protein content1. Soybean sunburn is not a disease, but a physiological disorder caused by exposure to high temperatures and intense sunlight2. However, there are some diseases that can cause similar symptoms on soybean leaves, such as soybean rust3 and Cercospora leaf blight4, which are both fungal diseases.
The pathogenic fungi of soybean rust and Cercospora leaf blight have different modes of reproduction. Soybean rust produces urediniospores that are wind-dispersed and infect new hosts3. Cercospora leaf blight produces conidia that are rain-splashed and infect soybean leaves and pods4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of soybean rust and Cercospora leaf blight are also different. Soybean rust is an airborne disease that can spread over long distances by wind currents5. Cercospora leaf blight is a soilborne disease that can survive in infected plant debris and be transmitted by rain or irrigation water4.
The period of disease onset for soybean rust and Cercospora leaf blight varies depending on the environmental conditions and the soybean growth stage. Soybean rust usually appears after flowering, beginning on lower leaves3. Cercospora leaf blight usually appears during pod fill, starting on upper leaves4. The environmental conditions required for the disease development of soybean rust and Cercospora leaf blight are also different. Soybean rust prefers warm and humid conditions, with temperatures ranging from 59Г‚В°F to 82Г‚В°F and relative humidity above 75%3. Cercospora leaf blight prefers hot and dry conditions, with temperatures above 86Г‚В°F and low rainfall4.
The overwintering method of soybean rust and Cercospora leaf blight are also different. Soybean rust does not overwinter in most areas of the U.S., but survives on alternative hosts in the southern regions or re-enters from tropical areas each year3. Cercospora leaf blight overwinters in infected plant debris or seeds, and can survive for several years in the soil4.
Planting soybeans in narrow rows to increase canopy closure and shade the lower leaves1.
Avoiding over-fertilization with nitrogen, which can increase leaf size and susceptibility to sunburn1.
Applying irrigation during periods of high temperature and drought stress to reduce leaf temperature and water loss1.
Selecting tolerant varieties that have smaller leaves, thicker cuticles, or higher levels of antioxidants1.
["Reddish-brown discoloration of the upper or lower leaf surface, usually along the veins or interveinal tissue2 1.", "The discoloration may be translucent when held up to the light and may have a yellow halo around it2 1.", "The affected leaf tissue may become sunken, necrotic, or fall out, giving the leaves a ragged appearance2 1.", "The symptoms are usually more severe on the upper leaves in the canopy that are exposed to direct sunlight2 1."]
["Soybean rust produces tan to reddish-brown pustules on the lower leaf surface that contain masses of spores.", "Cercospora leaf blight produces gray to black specks on the upper leaf surface that are the fruiting bodies of the fungus."]
