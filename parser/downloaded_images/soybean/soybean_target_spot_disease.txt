Soybean is a cash crop that is used for oil and protein production1. Soybean target disease is caused by a fungal pathogen called Corynespora cassiicola2 1 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of the disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, irrigation, and canopy density. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions with frequent rainfall or overhead irrigation. The disease usually starts in the lower canopy and progresses upward as the season advances4 3.
The period of disease onset for soybean target disease varies depending on the region and the weather conditions. In the Southeast region of the United States, where the disease is more prevalent, the disease can appear as early as late June or early July. In the Mid-South region, where the disease is less common, the disease can appear in late July or August1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity (greater than 80%) and warm temperatures within the crop canopy (75 to 85Г‚В°F). The disease is more likely to occur in fields with high plant populations, narrow row spacing, high nitrogen fertilization, and susceptible cultivars1 3.
The overwintering method of the disease is by surviving on infected crop residue that remains on the soil surface or buried in the soil. The fungus can also infect other hosts such as cotton, tomato, cucumber, and other legumes1.
Foliar fungicides can be applied to reduce the severity and spread of the disease, especially in fields with a history of target spot or high disease risk. Fungicides should be applied at early pod set (R3 to R4) or when the first symptoms appear in the lower canopy. Fungicides with different modes of action should be rotated or tank-mixed to prevent fungicide resistance1 2 3.
Infected crop residue should be removed or buried by tillage to reduce the inoculum source for the next season2 3.
There is no information on biological control agents for soybean target disease.
Cultural practices such as crop rotation, planting disease-free seed, using resistant or tolerant cultivars, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, reducing plant population and row spacing, and avoiding overhead irrigation can help reduce the disease incidence and severity2 3 4.
["Reddish-brown lesions, irregularly shaped, with concentric rings and yellow halos, on leaves, petioles, stems, pods, and seeds2 3.", "Lesions vary in size and shape depending on the plant part and the stage of infection2 3.", "Lesions may coalesce and cause defoliation, premature senescence, pod abortion, and seed discoloration2 3."]
["Dark brown to black stroma (fungal structures) within the lesions that produce conidia (asexual spores)2 3.", "Conidia are club-shaped, thick at the base and tapering at the tip, multi-septate, and brown-pigmented2 3."]
The mechanism of resistance may involve the production of secondary metabolites, such as cassiicolin, that act as phytotoxins and necrotrophic effectors1. The type of resistance agent may vary depending on the host plant and the environmental conditions. For example, some soybean cultivars may have partial resistance or tolerance to the disease1 2, while some cotton cultivars may have complete resistance conferred by a single dominant gene3. The level of resistance may depend on the genetic diversity and virulence of the pathogen population, as well as the interaction with other pathogens and pests1 2 3. 
Morphological observation of fungal structures and spores under a microscope1 2. Molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and DNA sequencing1 4 3. Serological techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence microscopy1. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the host plant and the fungal strain. For example, cassiicolin is a major effector in soybean and cotton, but not in tomato or cucumber1. Other effectors that have been identified include proteases, lipases, polygalacturonases, and xylanases1. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host range and specificity of the pathogen, as well as the susceptibility and defense responses of the plants. For example, soybean and cotton are highly susceptible to C. cassiicola , while tomato and cucumber are less susceptible or resistant1. Some plants may also have different mechanisms of resistance or tolerance to the disease1 2 3.
