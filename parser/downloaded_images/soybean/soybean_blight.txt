Soybean is a type of cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1 2. Soybean blight can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, or oomycetes3 1 4. Some examples of soybean blight diseases are bacterial blight, frogeye leaf spot, and southern blight.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of soybean blight depends on the specific disease. For example, the fungus that causes frogeye leaf spot reproduces by producing <em>conidia</em> (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or rain5. The fungus that causes southern blight reproduces by forming sclerotia (hardened masses of fungal tissue) that can survive in the soil for long periods of time4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of soybean blight also vary depending on the disease. For example, bacterial blight is spread by wind and rain and by cultivation when foliage is wet6. Frogeye leaf spot is favored by warm temperatures, humid conditions, and frequent rains5. Southern blight is favored by warm, wet conditions and high soil organic matter4.
The period of disease onset for soybean blight depends on the environmental conditions and the pathogen inoculum. For example, bacterial blight can occur at any time during the growing season, but is most common during cool, wet weather1. Frogeye leaf spot usually appears in mid to late season when soybeans are in reproductive stages5. Southern blight can occur at any growth stage, but is more severe when plants are flowering or podding4. The environmental conditions required for soybean blight are related to the optimal temperature, moisture, and soil conditions for the pathogen growth and infection. For example, bacterial blight is more severe when temperatures are between 15Г‚В°C and 26Г‚В°C and when there is frequent rainfall or dew formation1. Frogeye leaf spot is more severe when temperatures are between 24Г‚В°C and 30Г‚В°C and when there is high relative humidity or leaf wetness5. Southern blight is more severe when temperatures are above 28Г‚В°C and when there is high soil moisture and organic matter4.
The overwintering method of soybean blight depends on the type of pathogen and its survival structures. For example, the bacterium that causes bacterial blight can overwinter in crop residue and can be seed-transmitted1. The fungus that causes frog eye leaf spot can overwinter in infected plant debris or seed5. The fungus that causes southern blight can overwinter as sclerotia in the soil or plant residue4.
Planting resistant soybean varieties and using pathogen-free seed1 2 3.
Rotating with non-host crops such as corn, wheat, or sorghum2.
Avoiding field cultivation when the foliage is wet1.
Deep tillage to bury crop residue and reduce sclerotia survival2.
["Bacterial blight: Small, angular, water-soaked spots that turn yellow and then brown with yellowish-green halos on leaves; spots may merge to form large dead patches; dead tissue may fall out giving a ragged appearance; infection may also occur on stems, petioles, pods, and seeds1 4 3.", "Southern blight: Water-soaked lesions at or below the soil line; lesions may girdle the stem and cause wilting and death; white fungal growth and small brown sclerotia may be seen on the stem base and surrounding soil2.", "Frogeye leaf spot: Small dark spots that enlarge to circular or irregular lesions with gray-brown centers and reddish-purple borders on leaves; gray fungal growth may be seen on the underside of lesions5."]
["Bacterial blight: No visible signs of the bacterium on the plant surface; bacterial ooze may be seen when infected tissue is cut and squeezed3.", "Southern blight: White fungal growth and small brown sclerotia on the stem base and surrounding soil2.", "Frogeye leaf spot: Gray fungal growth on the underside of leaf lesions5."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the type of blight and the fungicide used. For example, <em>Cercospora kikuchii</em>, the causal agent of Cercospora leaf blight, has been reported to develop resistance to QoI fungicides (FRAC group 11) in some regions. The mechanism of resistance involves a mutation in the cytochrome b gene that reduces the binding affinity of the fungicide. The level of resistance can be measured by the effective concentration (EC50) of the fungicide that inhibits fungal growth by 50%. Another example is Sclerotium rolfsii, the causal agent of southern blight, which has been reported to develop resistance to thiophanate-methyl (FRAC group 1) in some regions. The mechanism of resistance involves a mutation in the beta-tubulin gene that reduces the binding affinity of the fungicide. The level of resistance can be measured by the effective dose (ED50) of the fungicide that inhibits fungal growth by 50%. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the type of blight and the availability of diagnostic tools. For example, <em>Pseudomonas syringae </em>pv<em>. glycinea</em>, the causal agent of bacterial blight, can be detected by using a bacterial ooze test. This involves cutting and squeezing infected tissue and observing for bacterial ooze under a microscope or on a glass slide1. Another example is <em>Cercospora kikuchii</em>, the causal agent of Cercospora leaf blight, which can be detected by using a detached leaf inoculation method. This involves spraying spore suspension on detached soybean leaves and incubating them in high humidity for 9 days to observe for disease symptoms2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease depends on the type of blight and the host-pathogen interaction. For example, <em>Pseudomonas syringae</em> pv. <em>glycinea</em>, the causal agent of bacterial blight, infects soybean through natural openings or wounds on leaves and stems. The bacterium produces several pathogenic effectors that suppress plant defense responses and cause cell death. Some of these effectors are AvrB, AvrRpm1, HopPsyA, HopPmaL, HopAF1, HopZ1a, HopZ3, HopAB2, HopAB3, HopAE1, HopAG1 and HopAO1 . The bacterium also produces a toxin called syringomycin that damages plant membranes and causes water-soaking. The infection may vary depending on the soybean genotype and environmental conditions1. Another example is <em>Sclerotium rolfsii</em>, the causal agent of southern blight, which infects soybean at or below the soil line. The fungus produces hyphae that penetrate and colonize the host tissue, causing water-soaking and wilting. The fungus also produces sclerotia that serve as survival structures and sources of inoculum3. The infection may vary depending on the soybean cultivar and soil temperature. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease depend on the type of blight and the availability of genetic information. For example, <em>Pseudomonas syringae </em>pv.<em> glycinea</em>, the causal agent of bacterial blight, may be targeted by manipulating plant genes that are involved in defense signaling or resistance. Some of these genes are Rpg1-b, Rpg4-b, Rpg5-b and Rpg8-b, which confer resistance to specific races or strains of the bacterium . Another example is <em>Xanthomonas axonopodis</em> pv. <em>glycines</em>, the causal agent of bacterial pustule, which may be targeted by manipulating plant genes that are involved in susceptibility or tolerance. Some of these genes are Rj2 and Rj4, which confer susceptibility to specific races or
