Soybean is a cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1 2. Nitrogen deficiency in soybean is not caused by a disease, but by a lack of nitrogen in the soil or poor nodulation of the roots1 3. Nitrogen deficiency can make soybean plants more susceptible to diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, or oomycetes4.
Not applicable, since nitrogen deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogenic fungus. Not applicable, since nitrogen deficiency is not a disease that has a mode of transmission or an epidemiological pattern.
Nitrogen deficiency in soybean can occur at any stage of growth, but it is more common and severe during the early seed development stage when the demand for nitrogen is high5 . Nitrogen deficiency in soybean can be influenced by various environmental conditions, such as: Low soil nitrogen due to leaching, denitrification, volatilization, or immobilization3 .Poor inoculation of the soybean seeds with rhizobia bacteria that can fix atmospheric nitrogen into plant-available forms1 4.Wet or compacted soils that reduce root growth and nodulation and limit oxygen availability for nitrogen fixation3 4.High temperatures that increase nitrogen demand and reduce nitrogen fixation efficiency5 .Low soil pH that inhibits rhizobia activity and nodulation4 .
Not applicable, since nitrogen deficiency is not a disease that has an overwintering method.
Apply no more than 45 of nitrogen at planting or early vegetative stages to avoid inhibiting nodulation1 2.
Physical measures: Improving soil drainage and aeration can enhance root growth and nodulation and reduce nitrogen losses due to leaching or denitrification3 4. This can be done by using tile drainage, subsoiling, or raised beds in poorly drained soils4.
Biological control: Inoculating soybean seeds with effective strains of rhizobia bacteria can increase nodulation and nitrogen fixation, especially in fields that have not grown soybean for several years or have low native rhizobia population3 4. Inoculation can also improve plant performance in stressful conditions, such as drought, high temperature, or low soil pH4.
Agricultural control: Adopting crop rotation, cover cropping, or organic amendments can increase soil organic matter and nitrogen availability for soybean plants3 4. For example, rotating soybean with legume crops (such as alfalfa or clover) or grass crops (such as corn or wheat) can provide residual nitrogen or enhance biological nitrogen fixation4. Planting cover crops (such as hairy vetch or crimson clover) or applying manure or compost can also supply organic nitrogen and improve soil quality4.
["Pale green to yellow leaves, starting from the older leaves at the bottom of the plant and moving upward as the deficiency progresses3 1 4.", "Stunted growth, reduced branching, fewer nodes, and smaller leaf size3 1 4.", "Reduced pod retention and seed fill, leading to fewer seeds per pod, smaller seeds, and lower seed protein and oil content3 1 4."]
["Poor nodulation, indicated by fewer, smaller, or inactive nodules on the roots3 1 4. Active nodules are pink or red inside, while inactive nodules are white, green, or brown inside4.", "Low plant tissue nitrogen concentration, measured by plant analysis or chlorophyll meter1 4. The critical level of nitrogen concentration for soybean is about 4% in the uppermost fully expanded leaves at early bloom stage4."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of nitrogen deficiency in soybean is not well defined, as there are many fungal pathogens that can infect soybean under different environmental conditions. However, some studies have suggested that Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani are more prevalent and aggressive in soybean fields with low nitrogen availability1 2. These fungi can cause root rot, wilt, and seedling blight in soybean plants. The mechanism of resistance of these fungi to fungicides is not fully understood, but some factors that may contribute are: the ability to produce mycotoxins that inhibit plant defense responses3, the presence of efflux pumps that reduce fungicide uptake, and the occurrence of genetic mutations that alter fungicide target sites. The type of resistance agent depends on the fungicide mode of action, such as demethylation inhibitors, quinone outside inhibitors, or succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors. The level of resistance varies depending on the fungal strain, the fungicide dose, and the environmental conditions. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of nitrogen deficiency in soybean is not widely available, as most methods require laboratory equipment and expertise. However, some possible methods are: microscopic examination of infected plant tissues for fungal structures, immunological assays using antibodies that recognize specific fungal antigens, or molecular assays using DNA or RNA probes that hybridize with fungal genes. These methods can provide rapid and accurate identification of fungal pathogens, but they may also have limitations such as high cost, low sensitivity, or cross-reactivity with other fungi. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of nitrogen deficiency in soybean is complex and depends on the interaction between the fungus, the plant, and the environment. Some general steps are: spore germination on the plant surface or in the soil, penetration of the plant cuticle or root cortex by fungal hyphae or appressoria, colonization of the plant tissues by fungal mycelium or haustoria, infection of the plant cells by fungal enzymes or toxins, and reproduction of the fungus by producing spores or sclerotia. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the fungal species and strain, but some examples are: cutinases, pectinases, cellulases, and xylanases, which degrade plant cell wall components; proteases, lipases, and phospholipases, which hydrolyze plant membrane proteins and lipids; and fumonisins, fusaric acid, and trichothecenes, which interfere with plant metabolism and signaling. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host specificity and compatibility of the fungus, as well as the plant resistance and susceptibility genes. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of nitrogen deficiency in soybean are not well studied, as most bacterial pathogens of soybean are associated with high moisture and temperature conditions. However, some possible targets are: nodulation genes, which are essential for symbiosis with rhizobia and nitrogen fixation in soybean roots; defense genes, which encode for proteins that recognize and respond to bacterial invasion in soybean leaves and stems; and yield genes, which influence plant growth, development, and seed production in soybean plants. These genes can be knocked out by bacterial effectors or by genetic engineering techniques to study their functions and interactions with bacterial pathogens.
