Soybean is a type of cash crop that is grown for its seeds, which are rich in protein and oil1. Magnesium deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogen, but a physiological disorder that results from low availability or uptake of magnesium by the plant2.
Since magnesium deficiency is not a disease, there is no pathogenic fungus involved and no mode of reproduction to consider. Magnesium deficiency can occur due to various factors, such as low soil magnesium levels, high soil acidity, high soil potassium or calcium levels, excessive rainfall, drought stress, or root damage3 4 5. The disorder can spread within a field or across fields depending on the soil conditions and environmental factors. It is not transmitted by insects or airborne spores.
Magnesium deficiency can occur at any stage of soybean growth, but it is more likely to appear during the reproductive stages when the demand for magnesium is high2 4. Magnesium deficiency is more common in sandy soils with low organic matter and low cation exchange capacity2 4. It can also occur in soils with high pH, high calcium carbonate, or high potassium levels that reduce magnesium availability2 5. The disorder can be aggravated by cool and wet conditions that limit root growth and nutrient uptake2 4.
Magnesium deficiency does not have an overwintering method since it is not a disease. However, the soil factors that cause magnesium deficiency can persist over time and affect subsequent crops unless corrected by liming or fertilization2 4.
The main control strategies are agronomic practices that aim to improve the soil magnesium availability and the plant uptake.

These include: liming acidic soils to increase the soil pH and reduce the antagonism of other cations such as potassium, calcium, and aluminum1 2 3; applying magnesium fertilizers such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, or dolomitic limestone1 2 3; avoiding excessive potassium or ammonium fertilization that can interfere with magnesium uptake1 2; irrigating adequately to prevent drought stress and enhance root growth1 2; and selecting soybean varieties that are more tolerant to low magnesium levels2.

["The chlorosis starts from the leaf margins and progresses towards the center, leaving a green triangle at the base of the leaf4 1.", "As the deficiency worsens, the chlorotic areas turn brown and necrotic, and the leaves may curl and drop prematurely4 1 2.", "Magnesium deficiency can also affect the flowering and pod setting of soybeans, reducing the yield and seed quality1 2."]
["There are no disease signs of magnesium deficiency since it is not a disease caused by a pathogen. However, one can use a soil test or a plant tissue analysis to confirm the low levels of magnesium in the soil or the plant1 2. A soil test can indicate the soil pH, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and magnesium availability, while a plant tissue analysis can measure the magnesium concentration in the leaves1 2. The critical level of magnesium in soybean leaves is about 0.2%1."]
