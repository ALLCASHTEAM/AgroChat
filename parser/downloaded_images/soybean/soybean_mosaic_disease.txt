Soybean is a cash crop that is mainly grown for its edible oil and protein-rich seeds1 2. Soybean mosaic disease is caused by soybean mosaic virus (SMV), which is a member of the plant virus genus Potyvirus (family Potyviridae)3 1 4. It is a viral disease that infects mainly plants belonging to the family Fabaceae but has also been found infecting other economically important crops3 1.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic virus of this disease is not clear, but it is likely that it replicates its RNA genome using a viral-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1. The virus does not produce spores, but it forms flexuous, filamentous virions of about 720Гўв‚¬вЂњ800 nm long and 12Гўв‚¬вЂњ15 nm in diameter that contain the viral RNA1 2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by several factors, such as host genotype, virus strain, plant age, environmental conditions, and aphid populations1 5. The virus can be transmitted by aphids in a non-persistent manner, meaning that they can acquire and transmit the virus within a few minutes of feeding on infected plants1 6. The virus can also be transmitted by infected seed, with rates varying from less than 1% to more than 90% depending on the cultivar1 6. Additionally, the virus can be transmitted by mechanical inoculation, such as sap contact or wounding1 6.
The period of disease onset for this disease depends on the time of infection and the environmental conditions. Plants infected at an early stage of growth tend to show more severe symptoms and yield losses than plants infected at a later stage1 6. Symptoms may not be apparent when temperatures are above 90Г‚В°F (32Г‚В°C), but they may reappear when temperatures drop6. Symptoms may also vary with different virus strains and host genotypes1 6. The environmental conditions required for the disease are mainly related to the presence and activity of aphids, which are the main vectors of the virus. Aphids prefer moderate temperatures (68Гўв‚¬вЂњ77Г‚В°F or 20Гўв‚¬вЂњ25Г‚В°C) and high humidity (80Гўв‚¬вЂњ90%)1. High rainfall and wind can reduce aphid populations and virus transmission1. The virus can also survive in low temperatures in infected seeds or plant debris1.
The overwintering method of this disease is through infected seeds or plant debris that harbor the virus. The virus can remain viable in seeds for several years under dry storage conditions1. The virus can also survive in plant debris that remains on the soil surface or buried under snow1.
This is the most effective way to prevent the introduction and spread of the virus in the field1 2. Seed transmission rates vary depending on the cultivar, but can be reduced by selecting healthy seeds and discarding infected ones3 2.
This is the most economical and environmentally friendly way to reduce the impact of the disease1 2. Several soybean cultivars have been developed that have different levels of resistance to different strains of SMV1 2. Some cultivars have pyramided resistance genes that confer broad-spectrum resistance to multiple strains1. Transgenic plants that express SMV genomic regions have also shown high levels of resistance to SMV1.
This can help reduce the transmission of the virus by the main vector3 2. Aphid control can be achieved by using insecticides, biological agents (such as predators and parasitoids), or cultural practices (such as crop rotation, intercropping, or trap crops)3 2. However, the value of insecticides to control SMV is uncertain, as aphids can transmit the virus within a short time of feeding and may not be killed by the insecticide before they move to another plant3 2.
This can prevent the spread of the virus by sap contact or wounding3 2. Mechanical inoculation can occur by using contaminated tools, equipment, or clothing, or by handling or pruning infected plants3 2. To avoid mechanical inoculation, it is recommended to sanitize tools and equipment, wear gloves and clean clothing, and avoid handling or pruning plants when they are wet3 2.
["Mosaic and mottling. These are the most common and characteristic symptoms of SMV infection. They appear as light and dark green patches on individual leaves, especially on young, rapidly growing leaves3 2. The patches may become raised or blistered along the main veins in some cases3 2."]
["The typical sign is plant dwarfism, with yellow green alternating flowers and leaves wrinkled, leaf edges curled down or twisted, hard and brittle texture, browning of leaf veins, and sometimes many blister like protrusions along both sides of the leaf veins."]
The mechanism of resistance is mainly based on the recognition of SMV effector proteins by the soybean resistance (R) protein, which triggers a defense response that limits viral infection and spread1 2 3. The R protein is encoded by the Rsv (Resistance to SMV) gene, which has four alleles: Rsv1, Rsv3, Rsv4, and Rsv51 2 3. Each allele confers resistance to different strains of SMV1 2 3. The type of resistance agent is the Rsv gene and its encoded R protein1 2 3. The level of resistance depends on the combination of the Rsv gene and the SMV strain. Some combinations result in extreme resistance (ER), which prevents systemic infection and symptom development; some result in immune reaction (IR), which allows systemic infection but no symptom development; and some result in susceptible reaction (SR), which allows systemic infection and symptom development1 2 3. The level of resistance can also be influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and light1 2 3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic virus of the disease is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)4. ELISA is a technique that uses antibodies to detect the presence of antigens, such as viral proteins, in a sample4. ELISA can be performed using commercial kits that contain specific antibodies for SMV4. ELISA can detect SMV in infected plant tissues or seeds with high sensitivity and specificity4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is related to the replication and movement of the virus in the host plant. The virus enters the plant cell through a wound or an aphid stylet and releases its RNA genome into the cytoplasm5. The viral RNA is translated into a large polyprotein that is cleaved into several functional proteins by viral proteases5. One of these proteins is the viral RdRp, which synthesizes a negative-sense RNA strand using the positive-sense RNA genome as a template5. The negative-sense RNA strand then serves as a template for producing more positive-sense RNA genomes or subgenomic RNAs that encode other viral proteins5. The viral genomes and subgenomic RNAs are encapsidated by another viral protein, the coat protein (CP), to form virions that can infect new cells or be transmitted by aphids5. The virus moves from cell to cell through plasmodesmata, which are cytoplasmic channels that connect adjacent cells5. The virus uses another viral protein, the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro), to interact with CP and modify plasmodesmata to facilitate viral movement5. The virus also uses HC-Pro and another viral protein, the cylindrical inclusion protein (CI), to suppress host RNA silencing, which is a defense mechanism that degrades viral RNAs5.
