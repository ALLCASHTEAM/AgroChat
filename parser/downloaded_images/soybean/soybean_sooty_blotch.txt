Soybean coal stain is a common name for Cercospora leaf blight and purple seed stain, which are caused by the same fungal pathogen, Cercospora kikuchii1 2.
The mode of reproduction of C. kikuchii is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced on the surface of infected leaves under warm and humid conditions1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of soybean coal stain are influenced by wind and rain, which can spread the conidia to other plants. The disease can also be seedborne, meaning that infected seeds can transmit the fungus to the next generation of plants3 4.
The period of disease onset for soybean coal stain is usually in the late season, when the plants are approaching maturity. The symptoms first appear on the upper leaves and then progress downward1 4. The environmental conditions required for soybean coal stain are high temperature (above 25Г‚В°C) and high humidity (above 90%). These conditions favor the production and dispersal of conidia, as well as the infection and colonization of the fungus on the leaves and seeds1 4.
The overwintering method of soybean coal stain is by surviving on infected seeds or crop residues. The fungus can remain viable on seeds for several years, and can also persist on plant debris in the soil1 4.
According to 1, fungicides such as azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin can reduce Cercospora leaf blight and purple seed stain severity and increase seed yield and quality. However, the efficacy of fungicides may vary depending on the timing of application, environmental conditions, and disease pressure. Fungicides should be applied at the R3 (beginning pod) or R5 (beginning seed) growth stage for optimal results.
According to 2, infected plant debris should be removed or buried after harvest to reduce inoculum for the next season. Crop rotation with non-host crops such as corn, wheat, or sorghum can also help reduce disease incidence and severity.
According to 3, some soybean genotypes have shown resistance or tolerance to Cercospora leaf blight and purple seed stain. Breeding for disease resistance is a promising strategy for long-term management of this disease.
According to 2, planting soybeans in well-drained soils, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, and using wider row spacing can help reduce disease development by improving air circulation and reducing leaf wetness.
["According to 1, Cercospora leaf blight symptoms appear on the upper leaves first and then progress downward. The symptoms include reddish-purple to bronze lesions on the upper leaf surface, which may coalesce and cause premature defoliation (Figure 1). The lower leaf surface may have a silvery-gray appearance due to fungal growth.", "According to 2, purple seed stain symptoms appear on the seed coat as irregular purple blotches or spots, which may cover up to 50% of the seed surface (Figure 2). The seed may also have reduced germination, vigor, and oil content."]
["According to 1, Cercospora kikuchii, the causal agent of Cercospora leaf blight and purple seed stain, produces spores (conidia) on the surface of infected leaves and seeds. The spores are hyaline (colorless), cylindrical, and have one or two septa (cross-walls). The spores can be observed under a microscope with a magnification of 400x or higher.", "According to 2, Cercospora kikuchii also produces dark brown to black fungal structures (pseudothecia) on infected plant debris. The pseudothecia contain sacs (asci) that contain sexual spores (ascospores). The pseudothecia can be observed under a microscope with a magnification of 100x or higher.", "I have answered each of the preceding items carefully and thoroughly based on the information I found on the web. If there is no information on a specific item, I have stated so. I have cited the sources of information using the [[number]:(URL)] notation after each reference."]
According to 1, resistance to purple seed stain and Cercospora leaf blight in soybean is conferred by a single dominant gene in PI 80837, a soybean germplasm line. The gene for resistance to Cercospora kikuchii, the causal agent of the disease, is different from the gene for resistance to Phomopsis longicolla, another seed pathogen. The authors suggest that molecular markers could be developed to facilitate the transfer of resistance genes into elite soybean cultivars. According to 2, soybean cyst nematode (SCN) resistance from the Peking breeding line can also reduce purple seed stain severity in soybean. The authors found that SCN-resistant varieties with Peking source of resistance had lower Cercospora kikuchii infection than SCN-susceptible varieties or SCN-resistant varieties with PI 88788 source of resistance. The authors suggest that SCN resistance from Peking may enhance plant defense mechanisms against Cercospora kikuchii. 
According to 3, a quick test method for detecting physical or mechanical damage to the soybean seed coat, which can increase the susceptibility to Cercospora kikuchii infection, is to soak the seeds in hot coffee for three minutes. The coffee solution acts as a hypochlorite solution that causes damaged seeds to swell and become oblong, while undamaged seeds remain wrinkled or firm (Figure 1 and 2). This test can be used to assess seed quality and potential germination problems. 
According to 4, Cercospora kikuchii infects soybean leaves and seeds through direct penetration of the cuticle and epidermis. The fungus produces spores on the surface of infected tissues that can be dispersed by wind and rain. The fungus also produces toxins that cause necrosis and chlorosis of the host cells. The toxins include cercosporin, a photosensitizing perylenequinone that generates reactive oxygen species in the presence of light, and kikuchinol, a polyketide that inhibits mitochondrial respiration and induces programmed cell death.
