Soybean is a type of cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1 2. Soybean herbicide damage is not a disease, but a type of physiological disorder caused by exposure to certain herbicides that affect the growth and development of the plant3 4.
Since soybean herbicide damage is not a disease, it does not have an epidemiological pattern or mode of transmission. However, some factors that can influence the occurrence and severity of herbicide injury include the type, rate, timing, and formulation of the herbicide; the environmental conditions; the soil properties; the crop variety; and the application technique3 4 5. The period of disease onset for soybean herbicide damage depends on when the plant was exposed to the herbicide and how long it took for the symptoms to appear. Some symptoms may be visible within hours or days of exposure, while others may take weeks or months to develop6 4 5.
The environmental conditions required for soybean herbicide damage vary depending on the type of herbicide and its mode of action. Generally, warm and wet conditions can increase the uptake and movement of herbicides within the plant, while cold and dry conditions can reduce the metabolism and detoxification of herbicides by the plant3 4 5. Some specific examples are: Herbicides that inhibit photosynthesis (such as atrazine) can cause more injury under high light intensity and low humidity3.
Since soybean herbicide damage is not a disease, it does not have an overwintering method. However, some herbicides can persist in the soil for longer periods of time and cause carryover injury to subsequent crops3 4 5. Some factors that affect herbicide persistence include the chemical properties of the herbicide; the soil texture, pH, organic matter, and microbial activity; and the rainfall, temperature, and sunlight3.
Applying a different herbicide with a different mode of action (how it affects weeds) to control the weeds that survived or emerged after the initial herbicide application. For example, if glyphosate (HG 9) failed to control waterhemp (a common weed in soybean fields), a postemergence application of fomesafen (HG 14) or glufosinate (HG 10) could be used1 2. However, chemical control may not be effective if the weeds have developed resistance to multiple herbicide groups or if the crop is too injured to compete with the weeds3. The type, rate, timing, and formulation of the herbicide should be carefully selected to avoid further injury to the crop or carryover to the next crop3 4.
Cultivating the soil between the rows to kill or suppress the weeds that are not controlled by the herbicide. Cultivation can be an effective and economical way to supplement control achieved with herbicides when soybeans are planted in wide rows5 6. However, cultivation may not be feasible or desirable in no-till or reduced-till systems, or if the crop is too advanced or damaged to withstand mechanical disturbance3 4.
Using natural enemies such as insects, fungi, bacteria, or viruses to reduce the population or impact of the weeds. Biological control can be a long-term and environmentally friendly option, but it requires careful selection, introduction, and monitoring of the biological agents7. Biological control may not provide immediate or complete control of the weeds, and it may be affected by weather, soil, and other factors

["Herbicide phytotoxicity in soybeans can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the herbicide used. For example, triazole (DMI) fungicides can cause interveinal chlorosis and necrosis that is commonly associated with either Sudden Death Syndrome or Brown Stem Rot. Another example is the ILeVO seed treatment, which can cause the tips of the cotyledons to turn a yellow-brown color."]

Herbicide injury or phytotoxicity can occur when soybeans are exposed to herbicides that they are not tolerant to, or when herbicides are applied at the wrong rate or time.
