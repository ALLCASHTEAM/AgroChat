Soybean is a cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1 2. Soybean downy mildew is a fungal-like disease caused by the oomycete Peronospora manshurica1 2 3.
The pathogen of soybean downy mildew reproduces by producing mobile spores called zoospores that swim in water or high humidity and infect the plant tissue2 3. The disease is airborne and spreads by wind and rain that carry the spores onto the plants4. The disease can also be transmitted by infected seed1 2.
The disease can occur on plants of all ages, but is most common after flowering begins1. Young leaves are more susceptible than older leaves2. The disease favors cool, wet, or humid weather conditions1 2. The optimal temperature for infection is 15-20Г‚В°C3. The disease does not require specific soil conditions5.
The disease overwinters on infected leaves and seeds1 2. The fungus can survive in crop residue for up to two years5.
Using certified disease-free seed and resistant soybean varieties1 2 3.
Rotating soybeans with a non-bean crop for at least one year1 3.
Burying infested residue where feasible and where disease has been severe1 3.
Applying pre and postemergence herbicides, placing a 10-inch band of herbicide over rows at planting, and using timely cultivation to minimize weed pressure4.
["Small, light green spots (not water-soaked) on upper leaf surfaces that enlarge and turn pale to bright yellow1 2 5.", "The spots may coalesce into large irregular brown areas with yellow margins6 1.", "Portions of the infected area may fall out, giving the leaves a ragged appearance6.", "Infection of pods and seed can also occur, resulting in a reduction in seed quality and marketability4."]
["Tan to gray tufts of fungal growth (sporulation) on lower leaf surfaces, especially under wet and humid conditions6 1 2 5. The presence of this sporulation is diagnostic for downy mildew1.", "Infected seeds may be cracked with a dull white appearance and partially or completely covered with a pale coating of fungal spores4 5."]
The increased resistance of older leaves and high temperatures that slow the development of downy mildew during mid-season1. The genetic resistance of some soybean cultivars that can limit the infection and sporulation of the fungus2 3 4. The use of fungicides that can inhibit the growth and reproduction of the fungus, if necessary3. However, fungicides are not recommended for downy mildew management as the disease rarely reduces yield1 2. 
Examining the leaves for signs of grayish to pale-purplish spores on the lower leaf surface during humid weather1 2. The presence of this sporulation is diagnostic for downy mildew1. Placing the leaf in a plastic bag with a moist paper towel and examining again for sporulation in about 6 hours1. Using molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the DNA of the fungus from leaf or seed samples. 
The production and dispersal of swimming spores (zoospores) by the fungus that can infect soybean leaves through stomata or wounds. The formation and germination of oospores (sexual spores) by the fungus that can survive in crop residue and on seed surface and initiate new infections. The secretion of pathogenic effectors by the fungus that can manipulate host immunity and induce disease symptoms such as chlorosis and necrosis. The variation in infestation of different plants depending on their susceptibility, resistance genes, environmental conditions, and fungal strains. 
В·AvrE: This is a widely distributed bacterial effector protein that can suppress plant water stress response by modulating ABA signaling pathway, creating an aqueous environment in the leaf intercellular spaces that favors pathogen growth and dissemination5.В·AvrPtoB: This is an effector protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that can target multiple proteins for ubiquitination and degradation in plant cells, including FEN kinase involved in immune signaling, CesA enzyme involved in cell wall synthesis and AQP aquaporin involved in water balance.В·AvrPto: This is an effector protein that can inhibit plant PTI response by interacting with Pto kinase and Fen kinase in plant cells, blocking their activation of downstream MAPK cascade.
