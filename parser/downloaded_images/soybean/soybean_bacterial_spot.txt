Soybean is a type of cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1 2. Bacterial spot disease of soybean is caused by a bacterial pathogen, <em>Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea</em>1 3.
The bacterial pathogen of bacterial spot disease of soybean does not have a fungal stage, so it does not reproduce by spores. It reproduces by binary fission, which is a process of cell division that produces two identical daughter cells4. The bacterial pathogen of bacterial spot disease of soybean is transmitted by wind, rain, insects, and infected seeds1 5. The disease is favored by warm and humid conditions, and can spread rapidly in the field3.
The period of disease onset for bacterial spot disease of soybean depends on the environmental conditions and the inoculum level. The disease can appear at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during the flowering and pod-filling stages1 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (above 25 в„ѓ) and high humidity (above 90%)1 3. The disease can also be influenced by the soil pH, with more severe symptoms occurring at low pH levels (below 5.5)3.
The overwintering method of this disease is through infected seeds and crop residues1 3. The bacteria can survive on the seed surface or inside the seed coat, and can also persist on the plant debris in the soil3.
There are no effective chemical agents for this disease, as fungicides do not work against bacteria1 2. Copper-based bactericides may have some effect, but they are not recommended due to their phytotoxicity and environmental impact3.
Infected plant parts can be removed and destroyed to reduce the inoculum source3. However, this may not be feasible or economical in large-scale production.
There are no known biological agents that can effectively control this disease3.
The best way to prevent or manage this disease is to use disease-free seeds, crop rotation, and tillage1 2 3 4 5. These practices can reduce the survival and spread of the bacteria in the soil and plant residues. Additionally, avoiding plant stress, insect damage, and wet foliage can also help minimize the disease severity3.
["Small, circular, water-soaked spots on the leaves, stems, and pods1 3.", "Spots enlarge and become raised, reddish-brown pustules with yellow halos1 3.", "Pustules may coalesce and form irregular lesions that crack and ooze bacterial exudate1 3.", "Infected leaves may turn yellow, brown, or black and fall off prematurely1 3.", "Infected pods may shrivel and drop seeds or produce discolored and malformed seeds1 3."]
["Bacterial exudate that dries into a white or yellow crust on the lesions1 3.", "Bacterial streaming that can be observed under a microscope from a fresh lesion placed in water3."]
Mechanism of resistance: The phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can detoxify plant glucosinolate hydrolysis products, such as isothiocyanates, via two pathways: conjugation to glutathione and hydrolysis to amines1. The latter pathway involves an isothiocyanate hydrolase that is homologous to a bacterial enzyme1. Type of resistance agent: The isothiocyanate hydrolase is a type of resistance agent that can degrade isothiocyanates into non-toxic products1. Level of resistance: The level of resistance conferred by the isothiocyanate hydrolase depends on the type and concentration of isothiocyanates, as well as the expression and activity of the enzyme1. The enzyme can promote fungal growth and virulence on glucosinolate-producing plants1. Quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a selective medium that contains oxalic acid and rose bengal2. Oxalic acid is produced by S. sclerotiorum and inhibits the growth of other fungi, while rose bengal suppresses bacterial growth2. The medium can be used to isolate <em>S. sclerotiorum</em> from infected plant tissues or soil samples2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the following steps: The fungus produces sclerotia, which are hard, black structures that can survive in the soil for long periods2 3. The sclerotia germinate under favorable conditions and produce apothecia, which are mushroom-like structures that release ascospores into the air2 3. The ascospores land on susceptible plant tissues and germinate to form infection cushions, which are masses of hyphae that penetrate the plant cells by producing cell wall-degrading enzymes and oxalic acid2 3 4. The fungus colonizes the plant tissues and causes necrosis, which is the death of plant cells due to the action of fungal toxins and enzymes2 3 4. The fungus produces more sclerotia inside or on the surface of infected plant tissues, which can fall off and contaminate the soil or seeds2 3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors of S. sclerotiorum are not well characterized, but some candidates include oxalic acid, cell wall-degrading enzymes, necrosis-inducing proteins, and small secreted proteins4 5. The differences in infestation of different plants by <em>S. sclerotiorum</em> depend on various factors, such as plant susceptibility, environmental conditions, fungal strain variation, and plant defense responses4 5. Some plants can resist <em>S. sclerotiorum</em> infection by activating defense mechanisms such as glucosinolate hydrolysis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, oxidative burst, and programmed cell death4 5.
