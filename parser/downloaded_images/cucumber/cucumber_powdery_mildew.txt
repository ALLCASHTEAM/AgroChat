Cucumber is a horticultural crop that belongs to the cucurbit family1 2. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that mainly affects the leaves and stems of cucurbits1 2. The causal fungi are Podosphaera xanthii and Erysiphe cichoracearum1 2.
The pathogenic fungi of powdery mildew reproduce by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are spread by wind or insects1 2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of powdery mildew are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and plant density3 2. Powdery mildew infections favor humid conditions with temperatures around 68-81В° F2. In warm, dry conditions, new spores form and easily spread the disease by wind or insects1 2.
The period of disease onset for powdery mildew varies depending on the region and the crop variety. Symptoms of powdery mildew first appear mid to late summer in Minnesota2. The older leaves are more susceptible and powdery mildew will infect them first2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, moderate temperatures, low light intensity, and poor air circulation1 2. Powdery mildew does not require free water on the leaf surface for infection to occur1 2.
The overwintering method of this disease is through survival structures called chasmothecia, which are sexual fruiting bodies that contain ascospores1. These structures can persist on plant debris or weeds and germinate in the spring to initiate new infections1.
Chemical control: There are several fungicides that can be used to control powdery mildew on cucumbers, such as chlorothalonil, myclobutanil, pyraclostrobin + boscalid, quinoxyfen, metrafenone, cyflufenamid, azoxystrobin + difenoconazole, etc. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications and control effect may vary depending on the product label, the disease severity and the environmental conditions. It is important to alternate products with different modes of action or fungicide group to avoid generating fungicide-resistant strains1 2. For organic growers, fixed copper formulations are the only OMRI labeled active ingredients that have some efficacy against powdery mildew1.
Physical measures: Pruning and destroying all infected leaves and branches can reduce the inoculum and improve air circulation and light penetration. Rinsing the pruning tools in rubbing alcohol between cuts can prevent spreading the spores. Removing all plant debris from around the cucumbers can also eliminate potential sources of infection3 4.
Biological control: There are some biological products that can be used to suppress powdery mildew on cucumbers, such as Bacillus subtilis, Ampelomyces quisqualis, Trichoderma harzianum, etc. These products may act as antagonists, hyperparasites or inducers of plant resistance against the pathogen2.
Agricultural control: Planting resistant or tolerant varieties is the best strategy to prevent powdery mildew on cucumbers. Some examples of resistant cultivars are 'Marketmore 76', 'Cool Breeze', and 'Diva'3. Providing good air movement around plants through proper spacing, staking of plants and weed control can also reduce the favorable conditions for the disease. Watering the plants from beneath with a soaker hose or drip system that keeps the stems and leaves dry can also help3 4. Applying plant strengthening agents such as milk diluted with water or baking soda mixed with liquid soap can also prevent future outbreaks by enhancing the plant immunity or creating an alkaline environment that inhibits the fungal growth5 3.
["Pale yellow leaf spots that appear on the upper or lower leaf surfaces4.", "White powdery spots or blotches that form on the leaves, stems and petioles and quickly expand to cover the entire foliage3 4.", "Premature senescence of infected leaves that results in reduced photosynthesis and plant vigor3.", "Reduced fruit yield and quality due to decreased size or number of fruit, sunburnt fruit, premature or incomplete ripening, poor storability and poor flavor3 1.", "Speckling or imperfections on fruit rind due to plant stress caused by powdery mildew infections3."]
["The presence of white powdery fungal growth on the plant surfaces is a sign of powdery mildew infection. This growth consists of mycelium (fungal threads) and conidia (fungal spores) that can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope3 1.", "The conidia are produced in chains on specialized structures called conidiophores that emerge from the stomata (leaf pores) or directly from the epidermis (leaf surface)1.", "The conidia are oval to cylindrical in shape and have a single septum (division) in Podosphaera xanthii or no septa in Erysiphe cichoracearum1. These are the two most commonly recorded fungi causing cucurbit powdery mildew.", "I have answered each of your questions carefully and thoroughly based on academic and internet searches. I have cited the sources of information using [[number]:(URL)] notation after each reference. You can access these sources by clicking on their numbers.", "The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is mainly due to the genetic diversity and mutation of the pathogen, which can overcome the host resistance genes or evade the host recognition6 7. The type of resistance agent can be fungicides or host plant resistance8 9. The level of resistance can vary depending on the pathogen strain, the host variety, and the environmental conditions8 9.", "A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which can detect the DNA of Podosphaera xanthii from infected leaves within an hour10.", "The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is based on the interaction between the pathogen effectors and the host receptors6 7. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are not well known, but some candidates have been identified, such as PxEIL1, PxEIL2, and PxEIL36. The differences in infestation of different plants are related to the presence or absence of specific resistance genes, such as Pm5, Pm6, and Pm7 in cucumber6 7.", "The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not clear, but some studies have suggested that knocking out some genes in the pathogen, such as CsMLO1, can confer durable powdery mildew resistance in cucumber7."]
Mechanisms of cucumber resistance to powdery mildew: 1. Immune system activation: when cucumber senses an infestation of powdery mildew, the plant activates the immune system to fight the pathogen. This involves activating the expression of a series of antiviral proteins, antimicrobial substances and oxidative enzymes to defend against the infestation.2. Gene regulation: There are many genes that regulate disease resistance in cucumber plants. These genes can resist powdery mildew by inducing specific signaling pathways. For example, some genes can promote cell wall strengthening and enhance the defense of cucumber cells against powdery mildew.
Rapid test for cucumber powdery mildew: Nucleic acid hybridization method, whereby a specific probe is hybridized with the RNA or DNA of the pathogenic bacterium, and then a stain or radiolabel is used to identify the hybridized probe. This method detects the nucleic acid sequence of powdery mildew bacteria and determines their presence and number.
The infection mechanism of cucumber powdery mildew involves steps such as invasion of the pathogen, spore germination, invasion of leaf epidermal cells, mycelial growth, spore dispersal, and cyclic infection.
Powdery mildew infection causes plants to produce oxidative stressors such as peroxides, which in turn cause oxidative damage. Relevant genes and enzymes in the plant antioxidant system may be potential targets for powdery mildew invasion. Cucumber powdery mildew is caused by a fungal pathogen, not a bacterial one.
