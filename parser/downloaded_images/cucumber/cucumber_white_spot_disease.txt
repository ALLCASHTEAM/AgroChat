The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop1, as cucumbers are grown for their edible fruits and belong to the Cucurbitaceae family2. The type of disease of this disease is a fungal disease, caused by the pathogen Cercospora citrullina, which infects the leaves and stems of cucumbers and other cucurbits.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in structures called conidiophores on the surface of infected plant tissues. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind. The conidia are dispersed by airborne or waterborne means, and can survive on plant debris or seeds. The disease is favored by warm and humid conditions, and can cause severe losses in yield and quality.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the cultivar, inoculum level, and environmental conditions. However, some studies have reported that symptoms can appear as early as 10 days after inoculation, or as late as 40 days after planting. The symptoms include white to gray spots on the upper surface of leaves, which later become necrotic and coalesce into large patches. The lower surface of leaves may show brown to black fungal growth. The stems may also develop lesions and cracks. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30В°C), high humidity (above 90%), and frequent rainfall or irrigation. These conditions favor the germination of conidia and the infection of plant tissues. The disease is more severe in regions with tropical or subtropical climates, or in greenhouses.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on plant debris or infected seeds. The fungus can persist on crop residues in the soil for several months, and can also be carried over to the next season by seeds that are contaminated with conidia or mycelium. Therefore, crop rotation, sanitation, and seed treatment are important strategies to prevent or reduce the disease incidence.
The most common cause of white spots on cucumber leaves is powdery mildew1, a fungal disease that can reduce yield and quality of cucumbers.
To control powdery mildew, you can use chemical, physical, biological, or agricultural methods, depending on the severity and stage of the infection.
You can spray fungicides such as chlorothalonil, myclobutanil, propiconazole, or sulfur on the affected plants, following the label instructions for dosage, frequency, and safety precautions2. You should apply fungicides before the disease becomes severe, and rotate different modes of action to prevent resistance2.
Agricultural control: You can plant resistant or tolerant varieties of cucumbers that are less susceptible to powdery mildew1. You can also practice crop rotation, avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, and use clean seeds and tools1.
["The main symptom of powdery mildew is the appearance of white, powdery spots on the upper surface of the leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits1. The spots may coalesce and cover large areas of the plant tissue1.", "The infected leaves may become yellow, brown, or necrotic, and eventually fall off1. The infected fruits may become misshapen, discolored, or rotten1.", "The disease may also reduce the plant vigor, growth, yield, and quality1."]
["The disease signs of powdery mildew are the presence of the fungal structures on the plant surface. These include:", "The white, powdery spots are composed of masses of fungal hyphae that grow on the epidermis of the plant tissue2.", "The hyphae produce spores called conidia that are easily dispersed by wind or water splashes2. The conidia are oval-shaped and single-celled, and can be seen under a microscope2.", "Some powdery mildew fungi produce sexual structures called cleistothecia that are spherical and dark-colored2. The cleistothecia contain ascospores that can survive harsh conditions and germinate when favorable conditions return2. The cleistothecia can be seen with a hand lens or a microscope2."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of cucumber leucoplakia is Rhizoctonia solani1 2, which can cause damping-off, root rot, stem canker, and leaf blight on various crops3. According to one study3, R. solani can detoxify plant-derived isothiocyanates (ITCs), which are natural fungicides, by two mechanisms: glutathione conjugation and hydrolysis. The former involves the formation of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-catalyzed adducts between glutathione and ITCs, which are then exported out of the cell or further metabolized by other enzymes. The latter involves the cleavage of the carbon-sulfur bond in ITCs by a yet unidentified enzyme, resulting in the formation of non-toxic compounds such as thiocyanate and ammonia. The study found that R. solani strains isolated from Brassica crops, which produce high levels of ITCs, had higher GST activity and hydrolytic capacity than strains isolated from non-Brassica crops, suggesting that these mechanisms are adaptive responses to host-specific defenses. The study also found that R. solani strains varied in their sensitivity to different ITCs, and that some ITCs, such as benzyl ITC and phenethyl ITC, were more effective than others in inhibiting fungal growth. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of cucumber leucoplakia is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is a technique that amplifies specific DNA sequences from a sample, allowing for the detection and identification of pathogens. PCR can be performed using primers that target specific regions of the fungal genome, such as the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region or the intergenic spacer (IGS) region. PCR can also be combined with other techniques, such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or DNA sequencing, to increase the specificity and accuracy of the identification. PCR has several advantages over traditional methods, such as culturing or microscopy, such as speed, sensitivity, and reliability. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of cucumber leucoplakia is necrotrophic. Necrotrophic pathogens are those that kill host cells before colonizing them, using toxins, enzymes, or other factors to induce cell death. R. solani is a typical necrotrophic pathogen that produces various cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs), such as cellulases, pectinases, xylanases, and proteases, to break down plant tissues and facilitate infection. R. solani also produces oxalic acid (OA), which is a key virulence factor that lowers the pH of the host tissue, chelates calcium ions, inhibits plant defense responses, and induces programmed cell death. R. solani can infect different plants by adjusting its expression of CWDEs and OA according to the host tissue type and resistance level. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of cucumber leucoplakia are genes involved in plant defense responses. One study used a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach to screen for tomato genes that affect susceptibility to R. solani. The study identified 19 genes that enhanced resistance when silenced by VIGS, and 10 genes that increased susceptibility when silenced by VIGS. The genes that enhanced resistance were mainly involved in signaling pathways mediated by salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), or ethylene (ET), which are plant hormones that regulate defense responses against pathogens. The genes that increased susceptibility were mainly involved in cell wall biosynthesis or modification, suggesting that these genes are important for maintaining cell wall integrity and preventing fungal invasion.
