Cucumber is a horticultural crop that belongs to the cucurbit family1 2. Target spot disease is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Corynespora cassiicola1 3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by air currents3 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by temperature and humidity. The disease is more severe under warm [25Гўв‚¬вЂњ35Г‚ВєC (77Гўв‚¬вЂњ95Г‚ВєF)] and humid conditions, and can also occur under moderately cool [21Гўв‚¬вЂњ26Г‚ВєC (70Гўв‚¬вЂњ80Г‚ВєF)] and fluctuating temperatures5 4. The disease can also spread through infected plant debris, weed hosts, and contaminated tools2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the cultivar. The first symptoms usually appear on older leaves as angular, yellow spots that enlarge and become circular with light brown centers and dark brown borders1. The spots may coalesce and cause leaf drop, stem lesions, and fruit rot2 6. The disease can develop at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during fruiting2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, long periods of leaf wetness, and warm to moderately cool temperatures1 2 4. The fungus can also survive in the soil for at least two years, or on weed hosts1.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris in the soil or on weed hosts1 2.
Use fungicides such as chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride, mancozeb, or pyraclostrobin + epoxiconazole1 2 3. Apply them preventively or curatively at 10-14 day intervals until 3-4 weeks before last harvest1 3. Spray both sides of the leaves and rotate fungicides with different modes of action to avoid resistance2 3.
Remove and destroy infected plant debris and weed hosts1 2. Sanitize tools and structures that may be contaminated1.
There is no information on biological control of this disease based on web searches.
Use resistant or tolerant varieties when available1 2. Rotate crops with non-host plants for at least two years1 2. Avoid overhead irrigation and excess nitrogen fertilization2. Provide adequate ventilation and spacing for the plants2.

The phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is Corynespora cassiicola, which can cause target leaf spot or brown leaf spot on cucurbits and other crops1. The mechanism of resistance involves detoxification of fungicides by the fungus, as well as mutations in the target site of fungicides that reduce their binding affinity2. The type of resistance agent can be chemical or biological. The level of resistance depends on the fungicide group, the fungus strain, and the environmental conditions2 3 . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is isolation and identification of the fungus from infected plant tissue. This can be done by plating small pieces of diseased tissue on a suitable culture medium and observing the fungal growth and morphology under a microscope. Alternatively, molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) can be used to detect the fungal DNA from plant samples4 5 . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the production and dispersal of fungal spores that land on the leaf surface and germinate under favorable conditions. The fungus then penetrates the leaf tissue through stomata or wounds and colonizes the intercellular spaces. The fungus produces toxins and enzymes that degrade the plant cell wall and cause necrosis and chlorosis of leaf tissue. The fungus also produces effectors that modulate the plant defense response and facilitate infection. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are not well known, but some candidates include necrosis-inducing proteins, proteases, lipases, and cutinases4 5 . Differences in infestation of different plants depend on the susceptibility of the host plant, which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors4 5 . 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not relevant, as there are no reports of bacterial pathogens causing target spot disease in cucurbits. However, some possible targets for fungal pathogens could be genes involved in plant immunity, such as pathogenesis-related genes, resistance genes, or signaling genes. Another possible target could be genes involved in plant metabolism, such as photosynthesis genes, antioxidant genes, or stress response genes.
