Cucumber anthracnose is a disease of cash and horticultural crops. Cucumber is a widely grown vegetable cash crop as well as a popular horticultural crop. Cucumber anthracnose is a fungal disease of plants caused by the fungus Cucumis sativus.


The cucumber anthracnose pathogen overwinters in the soil as mycelium and pycnidia with the remains of the disease, and the mycelium can also overwinter latently in the seed coat. The greenhouse in winter also provides an important place for the pathogen to overwinter. When the environmental conditions are suitable in the following spring, the overwintered mycelium and pycnidia produce a large number of conidia, which become the source of primary infestation.The pathogen overwintered on the seed or with the disease residue in the soil as mycelium or pycnidia.
Fungicides such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, copper, and strobilurins can be applied to protect the plants from infection or reduce the disease severity1 2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease pressure. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance level of the cultivar1 2 3.
Removing or destroying the infected plant parts can help reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease1 2 3. However, this may not be feasible or economical in large-scale production1 2 3.
There is limited information on the use of biological agents to control cucumber anthracnose. Some studies have reported that antagonistic bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens can inhibit the growth of Colletotrichum orbiculare in vitro, but their efficacy and safety in field conditions need further evaluation.
This involves the use of cultural practices that can reduce the favorable conditions for the disease development, such as crop rotation, resistant cultivars, weed management, balanced fertilization, proper irrigation, and timely harvest1 2 3. These practices can enhance the plant health and vigor, and lower the disease incidence and severity1 2 3.
["The disease initially appears as small, circular, water-soaked spots on the leaves, petioles, stems, and fruits of the plant1 2 4 3.", "The spots enlarge and become sunken, brown to black lesions with tan to gray centers1 2 4 3.", "The lesions may have concentric rings or a target-like appearance, giving the disease its name1 2 4.", "The infected leaves may turn yellow, dry up, and fall off prematurely, resulting in defoliation and reduced photosynthesis1 2.", "The infected fruits may develop cracks or rotting spots that render them unmarketable1."]
["The presence of acervuli (small cup-shaped structures) on the surface of the lesions that produce conidia (asexual spores) of the fungus1.", "The conidia are hyaline to pale brown, cylindrical to curved, with 0 to 3 septa (cross-walls) and a dark scar at each end1.", "The conidia can be observed under a microscope or by using a hand lens on a moistened leaf sample1."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is Colletotrichum orbiculare1 2 3 4. It can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as benzimidazoles and strobilurins, by mutations in the target genes or increased efflux of the fungicides. The level of resistance may vary depending on the strain and the fungicide. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which can detect the fungal DNA in plant samples within an hour without requiring sophisticated equipment or expertise. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the production of appressoria, which are specialized structures that penetrate the plant cuticle and cell wall, and infection hyphae, which grow inside the plant cells and secrete enzymes and toxins. The fungus can produce different types and numbers of pathogenic effectors, which are proteins that modulate the plant immune response and facilitate infection. Some of these effectors are host-specific, meaning they only affect certain plants, while others are host-non-specific, meaning they affect a broad range of plants. For example, one effector called COrF1 is host-specific and induces cell death in cucumber but not in watermelon. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not clear, as there is no evidence that bacteria are involved in causing anthracnose in cucurbits. However, some studies have suggested that endophytic bacteria, which live inside plant tissues without causing harm, may have a beneficial role in enhancing plant resistance to fungal pathogens, such as Colletotrichum orbiculare . Some of these bacteria may produce antifungal compounds, such as phenazines, pyrrolnitrin, and siderophores, or induce systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants.
