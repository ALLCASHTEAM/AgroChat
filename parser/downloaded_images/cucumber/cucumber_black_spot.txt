Cucumber is a horticultural crop that belongs to the cucurbit family, <em>Cucurbitaceae</em> 1 2. Black spot disease is a fungal disease caused by the fungus <em>Colletotrichum orbiculare</em>, which is also known to cause anthracnose1 3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in acervuli (small, cushion-like structures) on the infected tissues3 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by moisture and temperature. The disease is more severe under wet and warm conditions, and can also occur under cool and humid conditions5 2. The disease can spread through rain splash, irrigation water, wind, insects, infected seeds, plant debris, and contaminated tools1 2 3 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the cultivar. The first symptoms usually appear on the leaves as small yellow or brown water-soaked spots that grow and darken into sunken lesions1 2 4. The spots may coalesce and cause leaf blight, stem cankers, and fruit rot1 2. The disease can develop at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during fruiting2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high moisture, long periods of leaf wetness, and warm to cool temperatures1 2 3. The fungus can survive in the soil, on plant debris, or on weed hosts1 2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris in the soil or on weed hosts1 2.
Use fungicides such as chlorothalonil, copper hydroxide, mancozeb, or azoxystrobin1 2 3. Apply them preventively or curatively at 7-14 day intervals until 7 days before harvest1 3. Spray both sides of the leaves and rotate fungicides with different modes of action to avoid resistance2 3.
Remove and destroy infected plant debris and weed hosts1 2. Sanitize tools and structures that may be contaminated1.
There is no information on the biological control of this disease based on web searches.
Use resistant or tolerant varieties when available1 2. Rotate crops with non-host plants for at least three years1 2. Avoid overhead irrigation and excess nitrogen fertilization2. Provide adequate ventilation and spacing for the plants2.

The phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is <em>Colletotrichum orbiculare</em>, which can cause anthracnose or black spot on cucurbits and other crops1. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the target site of fungicides that reduce their binding affinity, as well as overexpression of efflux pumps that expel fungicides from the fungal cells2 3 . The type of resistance agent can be chemical or biological. The level of resistance depends on the fungicide group, the fungus strain, and the environmental conditions2 3 . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is isolation and identification of the fungus from infected plant tissue. This can be done by plating small pieces of diseased tissue on a suitable culture medium and observing the fungal growth and morphology under a microscope. Alternatively, molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) can be used to detect the fungal DNA from plant samples4 5 . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the production and dispersal of fungal spores that land on the leaf surface and germinate under favorable conditions. The fungus then penetrates the leaf tissue through stomata or wounds and colonizes the intercellular spaces. The fungus produces toxins and enzymes that degrade the plant cell wall and cause necrosis and chlorosis of leaf tissue. The fungus also produces effectors that modulate the plant defense response and facilitate infection. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are not well known, but some candidates include necrosis-inducing proteins, proteases, lipases, cutinases, and polygalacturonases4 5 . Differences in infestation of different plants depend on the susceptibility of the host plant, which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors4 5 . 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not relevant, as there are no reports of bacterial pathogens causing black spot disease in cucurbits. However, some possible targets for fungal pathogens could be genes involved in plant immunity, such as pathogenesis-related genes, resistance genes, or signaling genes. Another possible target could be genes involved in plant metabolism, such as photosynthesis genes, antioxidant genes, or stress response genes.
