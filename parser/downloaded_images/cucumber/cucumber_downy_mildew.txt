The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop. Horticultural crops are plants that are grown for their edible parts, such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers. Cucumbers are a type of fruit that belong to the cucurbit family, along with melons, squash, and pumpkins1. The type of disease of this disease is an oomycete disease. The downy mildew of cucurbits is caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis, which is an oomycete pathogen, otherwise known as a water mold. Oomycetes are not true fungi, but they share some similarities in their morphology and life cycle2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is a mobile spore. Pseudoperonospora cubensis produces two types of spores: sporangia and oospores. Sporangia are asexual spores that are produced on branched structures called sporangiophores, which emerge from the stomata on the lower surface of the leaves. Sporangia are dispersed by wind or rain and can germinate directly or release zoospores, which are mobile spores with flagella that can swim in water films on the plant surface. Oospores are sexual spores that are formed by the fusion of two compatible mating types. Oospores are thick-walled and can survive in plant debris or soil for long periods3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are airborne and waterborne. Downy mildew spores can spread quickly through the air or water, especially when there are favorable conditions such as high humidity, moderate temperature, and leaf wetness. The spores can also be carried by insects, water, or human contact4.
The period of disease onset for this disease is any time in the growing season. Downy mildew can infect cucurbit plants at any stage of their development, from seedlings to mature fruits. However, it tends to be more severe when there are favorable conditions such as high humidity, moderate temperature, and leaf wetness4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are temperatures between 59 and 68 В°C and cool nights with temperatures below 55 В°C; high humidity; dense plant growth with poor air circulation; excessive moisture4. These conditions favor the germination and growth of downy mildew spores on the plant surface.
The overwintering method of this disease is surviving on plant debris or alternate hosts. Downy mildew oospores can overwinter on infected plant debris or on other plants that serve as alternate hosts, such as weeds or ornamentals. In the spring, the oospores can germinate and produce sporangia that can infect new cucurbit plants3.
Fungicides that contain mancozeb or chlorothalonil as active ingredients can be applied at regular intervals to prevent or reduce the disease1 2. Some other fungicides that have been shown to be effective are Orondis Ultra, Ranman, Zampro, and Gavel3. Fungicides should be applied at 5- to 10-day intervals depending on the disease risk and the cucurbit type4 3.
Removing and destroying affected leaves or entire plants can help stop the spread of the disease2 5. Avoiding overhead watering and using drip irrigation can also reduce the humidity and moisture that favor the pathogen3 5.
There are no effective biological control agents for cucumber downy mildew available to home gardeners5. Some commercial products that contain beneficial microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, or Streptomyces lydicus may have some suppressive effect on the disease, but they are not as reliable as fungicides3.
Planting resistant varieties is the best way to prevent cucumber downy mildew1 5. Some resistant varieties are Dasher II, Marketmore 76, Salad Bush, and Thunder3. Crop rotation, wide row spacing, and trellising can also improve air circulation and reduce disease pressure3 2 5.
["Angular yellow spots on the upper surface of leaves that may coalesce and turn brown as the disease progresses3 6 5.", "Chlorosis and wilting of leaves, leading to premature defoliation and reduced yield and quality of fruits3 6 5.", "No direct effect on fruits, but indirect effects such as sunscald, poor flavor, misshapen cucumbers, and poor storability may occur due to loss of foliage3 6."]
["Grayish-purple sporulation of the pathogen on the lower surface of leaves, especially under humid conditions3 6 5.", "Sporangia (spore-producing structures) that are lemon-shaped and have a short stalk at the base6."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is Pseudoperonospora cubensis, which is an oomycete or water mold1. It has different races that can infect different cucurbit crops2. The mechanism of resistance involves host-specific recognition of pathogen effectors by plant resistance genes. The type of resistance agent can be genetic or chemical. The level of resistance varies depending on the crop variety, the pathogen race, and the environmental conditions2 . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect the pathogen DNA from leaf samples. Another method is immunofluorescence microscopy, which can visualize the pathogen spores using fluorescent antibodies. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the germination of pathogen spores on the leaf surface, followed by the penetration of the leaf tissue by a specialized structure called a haustorium, which allows the pathogen to extract nutrients from the host cell. The pathogen produces effectors that modulate the host defense response and facilitate infection. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the pathogen race and host species. Differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility between the pathogen and the host, which is determined by the presence or absence of specific resistance genes in the host and corresponding avirulence genes in the pathogen. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well known, as there are no reports of bacterial pathogens causing downy mildew in cucurbits. However, some possible targets could be genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, as these are essential for bacterial growth and survival. Another possible target could be genes involved in quorum sensing, which regulate bacterial communication and virulence.
