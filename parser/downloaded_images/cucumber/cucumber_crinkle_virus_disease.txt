Cucumber is a horticultural crop that belongs to the cucurbit family1. Cucumber crinkle virus disease is caused by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), which is a viral disease that affects many plant species2 3.
Cucumber mosaic virus does not have a pathogenic fungus associated with it, but it has a coat protein that protects its RNA genome1. Cucumber mosaic virus has a complex epidemiological pattern and can be transmitted by several aphid species in a nonpersistent manner, by cucumber beetles, by infected seeds, or by mechanical means such as garden tools or hands4 3.
The period of disease onset for cucumber crinkle virus disease depends on the time of infection, the host plant, and the environmental conditions. Generally, symptoms appear within 7 to 14 days after infection5. The environmental conditions required for the disease are not well defined, but high temperatures and low humidity may reduce the severity of symptoms1. The virus can also survive in many weed hosts that serve as reservoirs for overwintering and infection3.
The overwintering method of cucumber mosaic virus is mainly through weed hosts that harbor the virus and the aphid vectors that transmit it1 3.
There is no effective chemical control for this disease. However, some insecticides may help reduce the spread of the virus by aphids or cucumber beetles, such as imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, or pyrethroids1 2. These insecticides should be applied according to the label instructions and with caution to avoid harming beneficial insects or pollinators.
Infected plants and plant debris should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent further transmission of the virus1 2. Infected seeds should not be used for planting2. Crop rotation and sanitation practices can also help reduce the risk of infection1 2.
There are no known biological agents that can effectively control this disease. However, some natural enemies of aphids and cucumber beetles may help reduce their populations and thus limit the spread of the virus. These include ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps, and predatory mites1.

["The most common symptom of this disease is a mosaic pattern of yellow and green patches on the leaves of infected plants4 1 2 5. The leaves may also curl downwards and become distorted and wrinkled4 1 5.", "The growth of infected plants may be stunted due to a shortening of the stem segments between leaves (internodes)4 1 2 5. The plants may also produce fewer flowers and fruits4 1.", "The fruits of infected plants may be deformed, bumpy, pale, grayish, or bitter-tasting4 1 2. In flowers, white streaks or breaks may appear on the petals5."]
["The disease signs of this disease are not very obvious or distinctive. The only way to confirm the presence of the virus is by using laboratory tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)6. However, some possible signs that may indicate a viral infection are:", "The presence of aphids or cucumber beetles on the plants or nearby weeds4. These insects are the main vectors of the virus and can transmit it from plant to plant.", "The presence of other viral diseases on the same or nearby plants4. Some viruses can interact with each other and cause more severe symptoms or increase susceptibility to infection. For example, co-infection with zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) can enhance the symptoms of cucumber crinkle virus disease7."]
Cucumber crinkle virus disease is caused by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)1, which is a phytopathogenic RNA virus2. CMV can infect a wide range of plants, including cucurbits, and cause symptoms such as leaf mottling, curling, stunting, fruit distortion and bitterness1 2 3. CMV has a high degree of genetic diversity and can evolve rapidly to overcome host resistance2. The mechanism of resistance to CMV in plants involves RNA silencing, which is a process that degrades viral RNA and prevents its replication2. Some plants also have resistance genes that encode proteins that recognize and interfere with viral movement or replication proteins2. The level of resistance to CMV varies among different plant species and cultivars, and depends on the strain of the virus2 3. Some examples of resistant plants are yellow summer squash and zucchini with a high degree of resistance to CMV as well as WMV and ZYMV3, and cucumber varieties that produce a high percentage of unmottled fruit3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not applicable, because CMV is not a fungus but a virus. However, there are some methods to detect CMV in plant samples, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies that bind to the viral coat protein and produce a color change4, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which amplifies and detects viral RNA sequences5. 
CMV overwinters in perennial weeds or infected seeds and is transmitted by insects or mechanical means3. Aphids are the main vectors of CMV and can acquire the virus within 1 minute of feeding on an infected plant and transmit it to a healthy plant within 2 minutes2. Cucumber beetles are also a vector of CMV2. The virus enters the plant cell through wounds or natural openings and removes its coat protein to release its viral genome RNA into the cytoplasm2. The virus expresses two types of proteins that produce replication proteins and sub-genomic RNA that encodes more coat protein2. The virus replicates in membrane vesicles and moves from cell to cell through plasmodesmata with the help of movement protein2. The virus spreads systemically throughout the plant and causes symptoms such as mosaic, curling, stunting, distortion and bitterness1 2 3. The virus can infect different parts of the plant, such as leaves, stems, flowers and fruits1 3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors of CMV are not well known, but some studies have suggested that some viral proteins may act as suppressors of RNA silencing or modulators of host defense responses2. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host susceptibility or resistance, the viral strain and isolate, the environmental conditions and the vector population2 3. 
Developing and using resistant or tolerant cultivars that have RNA silencing or resistance genes against CMV2 3. Eliminating or reducing weed hosts and infected plants that serve as sources of inoculum for CMV3 4. Controlling or avoiding aphid vectors and cucumber beetles that transmit CMV by using insecticides, reflective mulches, trap crops or biological agents3 4. Avoiding mechanical transmission of CMV by using clean tools and hands when handling plants3 4.
