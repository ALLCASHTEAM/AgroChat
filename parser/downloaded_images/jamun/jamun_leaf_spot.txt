Jamun (Syzygium cumini) is a tropical and subtropical fruit tree that belongs to the Myrtaceae family1. Jamun is also known as Indian black plum, Java plum, jambul, or jamblang1. Jamun is considered a horticultural crop, as it is grown for its edible fruits that have medicinal and nutritional value1. Jamun is not a cash crop or a staple crop, as it is not widely traded or consumed as a staple food. Jamun leaf spot is a fungal disease caused by Glomerella cingulata, which is also the causal agent of anthracnose2. Jamun leaf spot is also known as jamun anthracnose or jamun fruit rot2. Jamun leaf spot is not a bacterial, viral, oomycete, or physiological disease.
The pathogenic fungus of jamun leaf spot reproduces by two types of spores: conidia (asexual spores) and ascospores (sexual spores)3. The epidemiological pattern of jamun leaf spot is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind2. The disease is more severe during the rainy season when there is high humidity and frequent wetting of plant surfaces2. The disease can also occur during dry periods if there is dew formation or irrigation2.
The period of disease onset for jamun leaf spot depends on the stage of plant development and the environmental conditions2. The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common and severe during flowering and fruiting stages2. The disease can also appear on young leaves and shoots during spring flush2. The disease symptoms usually appear within 7 to 10 days after infection2. The environmental conditions required for jamun leaf spot are warm and humid weather with frequent rainfall or irrigation2. The optimum temperature range for fungal growth and infection is between 20Г‚В°C to 30Г‚В°C2. The optimum relative humidity range for fungal sporulation and germination is between 80% to 100%2. The minimum wetness duration required for infection is between 6 to 12 hours2.
The overwintering method of jamun leaf spot is mainly by survival of the fungus in infected plant debris or soil2. The fungus can produce acervuli with ascospores that can remain viable for several months in fallen leaves or fruits2. The fungus can also survive in infected branches or buds that produce infected shoots (spikes) in spring2.
Fungicides such as Dithane Z-78 at 0.02% or Bordeaux mixture (2:2:250) can be sprayed on the affected leaves and fruits to reduce the disease severity and prevent further spread1. The application dose, period, and number of applications may vary depending on the disease incidence and environmental conditions, but generally, the fungicides should be applied at the first sign of infection and repeated at regular intervals until the disease is under control2. The control effect of fungicides may depend on the type and strain of the fungus, the resistance of the host plant, and the coverage and penetration of the spray2.
Infected plant parts such as leaves, twigs, and fruits should be pruned and destroyed to eliminate the source of inoculum and reduce the disease pressure2. Pruning should be done with clean and sharp tools to avoid wounding and spreading the infection2.
Some antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Trichoderma harzianum, and T. viride have been reported to inhibit the growth and sporulation of Glomerella cingulata, the causal agent of jamun leaf spot3. These biocontrol agents can be applied as foliar sprays or soil drenches to enhance the plant defense mechanisms and suppress the pathogen activity3.
Some cultural practices that can help prevent or reduce jamun leaf spot are: selecting resistant or tolerant cultivars, avoiding overhead irrigation or watering early in the day to reduce leaf wetness duration, maintaining good soil drainage and aeration, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, removing weeds and debris that may harbor the fungus, and rotating with non-host crops2 .
["On leaves: Scattered spots that are light brown or reddish brown in color. The spots may coalesce and form irregular lesions that cause leaf distortion and defoliation1 .", "On fruits: Small sunken spots that enlarge and become dark brown or black. The spots may crack and ooze pinkish spore masses. The affected fruits rot and shrivel1 ."]
["On leaves: Fungal fruiting bodies (acervuli) that appear as black dots on the spots or lesions. The acervuli produce conidia (asexual spores) that are hyaline or pale brown, one-celled, and oval-shaped .", "On fruits: Pinkish spore masses that exude from the cracks on the spots. The spore masses consist of conidia and ascospores (sexual spores) that are produced in perithecia (sexual fruiting bodies) ."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: I could not find any information on the mechanism of resistance, the type of resistance agent, or the level of resistance of the fungus that causes jamun leaf spot. The fungus is identified as Glomerella cingulata1, but there is no specific information on how it resists fungicides or other control measures. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: I could not find any information on a quick test method for the fungus that causes jamun leaf spot. There may be some laboratory methods for isolating and identifying the fungus, but they are not available online. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease: I could not find any information on the type and number of pathogenic effectors, differences in infestation of different plants, or other details of the mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of jamun leaf spot. The only information I found was that the fungus infects the leaves and fruits of jamun trees, causing scattered spots, light brown or reddish brown in colour, and fruit rot and shrivel1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease: I could not find any information on the phytopathogenic bacteria of jamun leaf spot. The disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium1. Therefore, there are no potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease.
