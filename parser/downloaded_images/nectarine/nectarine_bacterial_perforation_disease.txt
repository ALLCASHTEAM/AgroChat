Nectarine is a type of stone  fruit1 2 3, which is a horticultural crop4. Horticultural crops are plants that are grown for human consumption or ornamental purposes4. Bacterial perforation disease of nectarine is caused by a bacterium called <em>Xanthomonas arboricola</em> pv. pruni (XAP), formerly <em>Xanthomonas campestris</em> pv. pruni1 2 3. It is also known as bacterial spot, bacteriosis, bacterial leaf spot, or bacterial shot hole1.
The bacterium XAP does not have a fungal component, so it does not have a mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus. Bacteria reproduce by binary fission, which is a process of splitting into two identical cells5. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of bacterial perforation disease of nectarine are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, and sand abrasion6 2. The bacterium XAP overwinters in dark, gummy branch tips and diseased twigs, and can be spread by rain splash, wind-driven rain, insects, pruning tools, and spraying equipment1 2. The bacterium enters the plant through natural openings or wounds on leaves, fruit, and twigs1 2.
The period of disease onset for bacterial perforation disease of nectarine varies depending on the host susceptibility and the environmental conditions. Generally, leaf symptoms appear after bloom, fruit symptoms appear after shuck split and increase after pit hardening, and twig symptoms appear in late summer or fall1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm (above 75Г‚В°F), wet (more than 6 hours of leaf wetness), and windy conditions that favor the spread and infection of the bacterium XAP1 2. Sandy soils and sites that cause abrasion and wounding of the plant tissues also increase the risk of the disease1 2.
The overwintering method of this disease is to survive in dark, gummy branch tips and diseased twigs that can serve as sources of inoculum for the next season1 2.
Chemical control: The use of copper-based bactericides (such as Kocide, Cuprofix, or Badge) or oxytetracycline-based antibiotics (such as FireLine or Mycoshield) can help to reduce the bacterial population and prevent infection1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label, the disease severity, and the environmental conditions1 2. The control effect may vary depending on the host resistance and the bacterial strain1 2.
Physical measures: The removal and destruction of infected plant parts (such as mummified fruits, gummy branch tips, and diseased twigs) can help to reduce the inoculum sources and prevent further spread of the disease1 2 3. Pruning should be done after harvest or early bud burst to avoid pruning wounds that can serve as entry points for the bacterium1 3. Pruning tools should be disinfected between cuts to avoid transmitting the bacterium1 2.
Biological control: The use of beneficial microorganisms (such as <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> or <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em>) can help to suppress the growth and activity of the bacterium XAP by competing for nutrients and space, producing antimicrobial substances, or inducing plant resistance2. These biocontrol agents can be applied as foliar sprays or soil drenches2.
Agricultural control: The use of resistant or tolerant cultivars is the most effective and economical way to control bacterial perforation disease of nectarine1 2. Other cultural practices that can help to reduce the disease risk include thinning of crowded fruit, avoiding overhead irrigation, improving air circulation, reducing sand abrasion, and harvesting carefully to avoid fruit damage1 2.
["Fruit spots: The infected fruit develop small brown spots that may originate from insect wounds or natural openings. The spots expand and become deep-pitted, cracked, gummed, or water-soaked. The infected areas may turn black and dry into mummies that remain attached to the tree or fall to the ground1 2.", "Leaf spots: The infected leaves develop small, water-soaked, grayish areas that become angular and purple, black, or brown in color. The spots are confined by the leaf veins and may drop out, giving the leaves a shot hole appearance. The infected leaves may also turn yellow and fall prematurely1 2.", "Twig cankers: The infected twigs develop dark, gummy lesions that are associated with leaf and flower buds. The infected buds may fail to open or die. The lesions may extend along the twig and cause branch cankers. Gummosis and fungal tufts may also appear on the infected twigs and cankers1 2."]
["Fungal tufts: The infected fruit, twigs, and cankers may produce tan-gray fungal tufts that consist of spores of the brown rot fungus <em>(Monilinia fructicola</em>), which is a secondary invader that takes advantage of the bacterial infection1 2.", "Bacterial secretions: The infected fruit, twigs, and cankers may ooze with sap that contains bacterial cells and exopolysaccharides (EPS), which are sticky substances produced by the bacterium XAP2. These secretions may also form a whitish film on the surface of the infected tissues when dried2."]
The bacterium XAP may have a type III secretion system (T3SS) that allows it to inject effector proteins into the plant cells and manipulate their defense responses1 2. Some of these effectors may suppress plant immunity, induce cell death, or modulate hormone signaling1 2. The bacterium XAP may produce exopolysaccharides (EPS) that form a protective layer around the bacterial cells and prevent them from being recognized by the plant receptors1 2. EPS may also help the bacterium to adhere to the plant surface, form biofilms, and resist environmental stresses1 2. The bacterium XAP may have plasmids that carry genes for antibiotic resistance or copper tolerance1 2. These genes may enable the bacterium to survive the chemical control measures applied by the growers1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that can detect and identify the bacterium XAP from plant samples3 4. PCR is a technique that amplifies a specific region of DNA using primers and enzymes3 4. PCR can be performed in a laboratory or in a field setting using portable devices3 4. 
The bacterium XAP overwinters in infected plant tissues (such as mummified fruits, gummy branch tips, and diseased twigs) and produces spores that can be dispersed by rain splash, wind-driven rain, insects, pruning tools, or spraying equipment1 2. The bacterium XAP lands on the plant surface and attaches to it using EPS, pili, or flagella1 2. The bacterium XAP may also form biofilms with other bacteria to enhance its survival and virulence1 2. The bacterium XAP enters the plant through natural openings (such as stomata or lenticels) or wounds (caused by insect feeding, sand abrasion, or mechanical damage)1 2. The bacterium XAP may also use its T3SS to inject effectors into the plant cells and facilitate its invasion1 2. The bacterium XAP colonizes the plant tissues (such as leaves, fruit, and twigs) and causes symptoms such as spots, pits, cracks, gummosis, water-soaking, necrosis, chlorosis, and defoliation1 2. The bacterium XAP may also interact with other pathogens (such as the brown rot fungus) and increase the disease severity1 2.
