The type of crop of this plant: Kale is a horticultural crop that belongs to the Brassica family. It is grown for its edible leaves that are rich in nutrients and antioxidants1. The type of disease of this disease: Kale drug damage is a physiological disease that is caused by the interaction between certain drugs and chemicals found in kale. It is not caused by a pathogen such as a fungus, bacterium, virus, or oomycete2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease: There is no pathogenic fungus involved in this disease, so this question is not applicable. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease: Kale drug damage occurs when people who take certain medications also consume kale or other cruciferous vegetables that contain high levels of glucosinolates. Glucosinolates are natural compounds that can interfere with the metabolism or absorption of some drugs and cause adverse effects3 4. The disease is transmitted by ingestion of kale or other glucosinolate-containing foods while taking certain drugs2 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease: Kale drug damage can occur within hours or days after consuming kale or other glucosinolate-containing foods while taking certain drugs. The onset and severity of the disease depend on the type and dose of the drug, the amount and frequency of kale consumption, and the individual's genetic and health factors2 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease: Kale drug damage does not depend on environmental conditions, but on dietary and pharmacological factors. However, some environmental factors such as temperature, light, and soil conditions can affect the glucosinolate content of kale and other cruciferous vegetables.
The overwintering method of this disease: There is no overwintering method for this disease, as it is not caused by a pathogen.
Cypermethrin: A synthetic pyrethroid insecticide that can be used to control aphids, caterpillars, flea beetles, and whiteflies. The recommended dose is 0.02-0.05% spray solution, applied at 7-14 -day intervals. The control effect is 80-90%.
Deltamethrin: Another synthetic pyrethroid insecticide that can be used to control aphids, caterpillars, flea beetles, and whiteflies. The recommended dose is 0.005-0.01% spray solution, applied at 7-14 -day intervals. The control effect is 80-90%.
Boscalid: A fungicide that can be used to control alternaria leaf spot, downy mildew, gray mold, and white mold. The recommended dose is 0.05-0.1% spray solution, applied at 7-14 -day intervals. The control effect is 80-90%.
Azoxystrobin: Another fungicide that can be used to control alternaria leaf spot, downy mildew, gray mold, and white mold. The recommended dose is 0.02-0.04% spray solution, applied at 7-14 -day intervals. The control effect is 80-90%.
["Cutting off the infected parts: This can help reduce the spread of diseases and pests by removing the source of inoculum or infestation. For example, cutting off the infected leaves can help control alternaria leaf spot and downy mildew.", "Hand picking: This can help reduce the population of pests by manually removing them from the plants. For example, hand picking can help control caterpillars and snails."]
["Crop rotation: This can help break the life cycle of pests and diseases by changing the host plants every season or year. For example, rotating cabbage with non-cruciferous crops can help reduce the incidence of clubroot and black rot.", "Intercropping: This can help enhance the diversity and stability of the agroecosystem by growing different crops together in the same field. For example, intercropping cabbage with garlic or onion can help repel aphids and whiteflies."]
According to 1, the white mold fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can detoxify the isothiocyanates produced by the glucosinolate-myrosinase system of cabbage plants. The mechanism of resistance is based on an isothiocyanate hydrolase that converts isothiocyanates into non-toxic amines. This enzyme is homologous to a bacterial enzyme and contributes to the virulence of the fungus on glucosinolate-producing plants. According to 2, some phytopathogenic fungi can produce mycotoxins that interfere with the plant defense system and induce plant susceptibility. For example, Fusarium graminearum produces deoxynivalenol (DON), which inhibits protein synthesis and induces cell death in plant cells. The fungus can also modify DON to produce 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-ADON) and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15-ADON), which are more toxic and resistant to degradation by plant enzymes. 
According to 3, a quick test method for the detection of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in cabbage plants is based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). This method uses four primers that specifically amplify a region of the actin gene of the fungus. The amplification can be performed at a constant temperature of 65 В°C for 60 min and detected by visual inspection of color change or fluorescence. 
According to 1, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infects cabbage plants by producing sclerotia, which are hard structures that can survive in soil for long periods. The sclerotia germinate under favorable conditions and produce apothecia, which are mushroom-like structures that release airborne spores. The spores land on plant tissues and germinate to form hyphae, which penetrate the plant cells and secrete enzymes and toxins that cause tissue necrosis and wilting. According to 2, Fusarium graminearum infects cabbage plants by producing macroconidia, which are multicellular spores that are dispersed by wind or rain splash. The macroconidia germinate on plant surfaces and form infection cushions, which are masses of hyphae that penetrate the plant cuticle and cell wall. The fungus then colonizes the plant vascular system and produces mycotoxins that disrupt plant metabolism and defense. 
Phytotoxicity refers to the damage caused to plants by exposure to chemicals or other substances. It is not caused by bacteria or any other pathogen. Therefore, there are no specific genes or bacteria associated with phytotoxicity in cabbage.
