Sorghum is a type of cereal crop that can be used for food, feed, fuel, or industrial purposes1. It is considered a staple crop in many parts of the world, especially in Africa and Asia, where it provides food security and income for millions of people1. Bacterial red streak disease of sorghum is a type of bacterial disease that is caused by the gram-negative bacterium <em>Pseudomonas andropogoni</em>2 3. This bacterium belongs to the genus <em>Pseudomonas</em>, which comprises many plant pathogenic bacteria that cause diseases on various crops4.
The mode of reproduction of the phytopathogenic bacterium of bacterial red streak disease is by binary fission, which is a process of asexual reproduction where one bacterial cell divides into two identical daughter cells4. The bacterium can also produce conidia, which are asexual spores that are formed at the end of specialized filaments called conidiophores4. The conidia can be dispersed by wind, water, insects, or other vectors and germinate to produce new bacterial cells4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of bacterial red streak disease are influenced by several factors, such as host susceptibility, inoculum source, environmental conditions, and disease management practices5 4. The disease can be transmitted by airborne, waterborne, or insect-borne means3 4. Airborne transmission occurs when the conidia or bacterial cells are carried by wind currents from infected plants or residues to healthy plants3 4. Waterborne transmission occurs when the conidia or bacterial cells are splashed by rain or irrigation water from infected plants or residues to healthy plants3 4. The insect-borne transmission occurs when the conidia or bacterial cells are carried by insects, such as aphids or leafhoppers, that feed on infected plants and then move to healthy plants3 4.
The period of disease onset for bacterial red streak disease depends on the stage of plant growth, the level of inoculum, and the environmental conditions3 4. The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more severe and damaging when it occurs at the early vegetative stage or the flowering stage3 4. The level of inoculum determines the initial infection rate and the subsequent disease development3 4. The environmental conditions affect the survival and activity of the bacterium and the host response3 4. The disease is favored by warm (25-30В°C), humid (80-100% relative humidity), and wet (frequent rainfall or irrigation) conditions3 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are similar to those mentioned in the previous answer. The bacterium can survive and multiply in a wide range of temperatures (10-40В°C), but it prefers warm (25-30В°C) temperatures for optimal growth and infection4. The bacterium also requires high humidity (80-100% relative humidity) and moisture (frequent rainfall or irrigation) for spore production, dispersal, germination, and penetration4. The soil conditions may also affect the disease, as acidic soils (pH 5-6) may enhance the survival and activity of the bacterium compared to alkaline soils (pH 7-8)4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on plant residues or infected seeds that remain in the field after harvest3 4. The bacterium can persist on plant residues for several months, especially under moist and cool conditions3 4. The bacterium can also infect seeds during flowering or harvesting and remain viable on seeds for long periods3 4.
There is no specific chemical control for this disease. However, some sources suggest that copper-based bactericides may reduce the severity of the infection1 2.
Infected plants or plant parts should be removed and destroyed to prevent further spread of the disease1.
There is no known biological control for this disease.
The following practices may help prevent or reduce the disease1 3: Plant-resistant or tolerant varieties of sorghum. Avoid planting sorghum near Johnsongrass or other grassy weeds that may harbor the bacterium. Avoid overhead irrigation or excessive soil moisture that may favor bacterial growth and infection. Rotate crops with non-host plants such as legumes or cotton. Use clean seed and equipment.
["The first symptoms are narrow, water-soaked, transparent leaf streaks, 2-3 mm wide by 2-15 mm long, appearing as early as the second leaf stage of the seedling3.", "Lesions soon turn red, become opaque, and at intervals may broaden into somewhat irregularly shaped oval spots with tan centers and narrow red margins3.", "The spots may coalesce to form larger areas of infected tissue1.", "The leaves may become distorted, curled, or twisted1.", "The disease may also affect the stems, peduncles, and panicles, causing reddish-brown to black stripes or blotches that may reduce grain yield and quality1 4."]
["The disease signs are the presence of bacterial slime or ooze on the surface of the lesions, especially when wet1 4.", "The slime may dry and form a crusty layer on the lesions4.", "The bacterium can be isolated from the infected tissue and cultured on artificial media for identification3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus to the disease is not well studied, but some sources suggest that it may be related to the production of antibiotics or toxins that inhibit the growth of the bacterium1. The type and level of resistance may vary depending on the strain of the fungus and the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is not available, but some possible methods are isolation and identification of the bacteria from infected plant tissues, molecular detection using specific primers or probes, or serological detection using antibodies or antigens1. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is also not well understood, but some sources suggest that it may involve the invasion of the fungus into the plant cells, the production of enzymes or toxins that damage the plant tissues, and the triggering of plant defense responses that may limit or enhance the disease development1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the strain of the fungus and the host plant species1. Differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the susceptibility or resistance of the plants to the fungus, as well as the environmental factors that influence the disease cycle1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not known, but some possible targets are genes that are involved in cell wall synthesis, photosynthesis, signal transduction, or stress tolerance1. Knockout lethal genes are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of an organism, and their disruption may result in death or severe defects1. However, identifying and targeting such genes may be challenging due to the genetic diversity and adaptability of the bacteria1.
