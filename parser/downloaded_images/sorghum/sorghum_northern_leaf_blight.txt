Sorghum maculatus is a grain sorghum variety that is grown as a staple crop for human consumption and animal feed1 2. Sorghum maculatus can be affected by several diseases, but one of the most common and destructive ones is anthracnose, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum graminicola2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of anthracnose reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind, rain, insects, or infected seeds3. Anthracnose can infect both leaves and stems of sorghum plants. The disease can be transmitted by airborne conidia from infected plants or crop residues, or by infected seeds that carry the fungus internally or externally3.
The period of disease onset for anthracnose depends on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the sorghum variety. The disease can develop at any stage of plant growth, but it is more severe during the flowering and grain-filling stages3. The environmental conditions required for anthracnose are warm and humid weather, with temperatures ranging from 20Г‚В°C to 30Г‚В°C and relative humidity above 85%3. The disease is also favored by wet leaves, frequent rainfall, and high plant density2.
The overwintering method of anthracnose is by surviving on crop residues in the soil or on the surface, or by remaining dormant in seeds3.




["According to one source, sorghum maculopathy is characterized by a convex anterior protrusion (bowing towards the vitreous cavity) of the macula associated with high myopia and a posterior staphyloma.1 The macula is the central part of the retina that is responsible for sharp vision. A staphyloma is an abnormal bulging of the eye wall. The symptoms of sorghum maculopathy may include blurred or distorted vision, central scotoma (a blind spot in the center of the visual field), metamorphopsia (a distortion of shapes or sizes of objects), and reduced contrast sensitivity.1 2"]
["The main sign of sorghum maculopathy is the dome-shaped appearance of the macula on optical coherence tomography (OCT), which is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses light waves to create cross-sectional images of the retina.1 2 The dome can appear in different orientations, so it is important to obtain both vertical and horizontal scans or radial scanning to ensure visualization.1 Other signs that may be seen on OCT include subretinal fluid accumulation, retinal pigment epithelium detachment, choroidal neovascularization, and intraretinal cysts.1 2"]
