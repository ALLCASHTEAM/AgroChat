Sorghum is a staple crop that is widely grown for food, feed, and fuel1 2. Sorghum blight is a fungal disease caused by Exserohilum turcicum3 4, which also causes leaf blight in maize and other grasses3.
The pathogenic fungus of sorghum blight reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain4 5. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of sorghum blight are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop density4 6. The disease is airborne and can spread rapidly under favorable conditions4.
The period of disease onset for sorghum blight varies depending on the stage of crop growth and the severity of infection. The disease can attack seedlings as well as older plants, but it is more common and damaging in the later stages of crop development, especially during grain filling4 5. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, moderate temperature (20-30Г‚В°C), and frequent rainfall or irrigation4 5. The disease is more severe in dense plantings and in fields with poor drainage or residue accumulation4 5.
The overwintering method of this disease is through survival structures called pseudothecia, which are formed by the fungus on infected plant debris or seeds4. These structures can produce sexual spores called ascospores, which can initiate new infections in the next season4.
Fungicides such as propiconazole, azoxystrobin, and pyraclostrobin can be applied to protect the foliage from infection. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity1 2. Chemical control can reduce the disease incidence and severity by 50-80%.
Infected plant debris and seeds should be destroyed or buried deeply to reduce the inoculum source3 . Infected plants can also be rogued out to avoid the secondary spread of the disease by wind3.
There is limited information on the biological control of sorghum blight. Some studies have reported the potential of antagonistic bacteria and fungi to inhibit the growth of E. turcicum in vitro or in greenhouse conditions. However, more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of biological control agents in the field.
Crop rotation with non-susceptible crops such as pulses and oilseeds can reduce the inoculum level in the soil3 1. Planting resistant or moderately resistant varieties is the most effective and economical way to manage sorghum blight3 1 . Some examples of resistant varieties are Co25 and Co263. Seed treatment with fungicides such as metalaxyl can protect the seeds and seedlings from infection3 1. Planting in well-drained fields with good drainage and avoiding dense plantings and residue accumulation can reduce the favorable conditions for the disease development1 .
["On seedlings: The disease appears as small narrow elongated spots in the initial stage and in due course they extend along the length of the leaf. The spots are reddish-purple or tan in color and coalesce to form large lesions. The infected leaves may wither or appear pale-green, and the plants may be stunted or die3 1.", "On older plants: The typical symptoms are long elliptical necrotic lesions, straw colored in the center with dark margins. The lesions may cover the entire leaf blade or form parallel stripes along the veins. The infected leaves may dry up prematurely, resulting in reduced photosynthesis and grain filling3 1 ."]
["On infected leaves: The fungus produces dark brown to black conidia on the surface of the lesions, giving them a velvety appearance. The conidia are cylindrical or slightly curved, with 7-11 septa and a truncate base. They are easily detached and dispersed by wind or rain3 4 .", "On infected plant debris or seeds: The fungus forms survival structures called pseudothecia, which are black spherical bodies embedded in the host tissue. They contain asci that produce ascospores, which are hyaline, fusiform, and have a single septum. The pseudothe.cia can be observed under a microscope or by soaking the infected material in water3 ."]
Sorghum blight is a term that can refer to different diseases caused by different pathogens. One of the most common and destructive sorghum blights is sorghum leaf blight, caused by the fungus Exserohilum turcicum1 2. This fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as benzimidazoles and strobilurins, by mutations in the target genes or by increased efflux of the fungicides3. The level of resistance depends on the frequency and intensity of fungicide use, the genetic diversity of the pathogen population, and the environmental conditions3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of sorghum leaf blight is immunostrip assay, which uses antibodies to detect the presence of the fungus in plant tissues3. This method is rapid, simple, and reliable, and can be performed in the field or in the laboratory3. Another test method is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which amplifies specific DNA sequences of the fungus from plant samples3. This method is more sensitive and specific than immunostrip assay, but requires more equipment and expertise3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of sorghum leaf blight is not fully understood, but it involves several factors, such as spore production, spore dispersal, spore germination, infection, and colonization3. The fungus produces spores on infected plant tissues, which are dispersed by wind or rain to healthy plants3. The spores germinate on the leaf surface and penetrate through natural openings or wounds3. The fungus then infects and colonizes the leaf tissue, causing necrotic lesions that reduce photosynthesis and yield3. The fungus may also produce toxins that contribute to disease development3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors that the fungus uses to manipulate plant defense responses are not well known, but some candidates have been identified by genomic and transcriptomic analyses3. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host susceptibility, which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of sorghum blight are also unclear, as there are few studies on this topic. One possible bacterial disease of sorghum is bacterial stripe, caused by Burkholderia andropogonis4. This bacterium may target some cell wall components or sugar transporters of sorghum, as suggested by comparative genomic analysis with other plant pathogenic bacteria4. Another possible bacterial disease of sorghum is bacterial stalk rot, caused by Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. zeae4. This bacterium may target some pectinases or cellulases of sorghum, as indicated by its ability to degrade plant cell walls and cause soft rot symptoms4.
