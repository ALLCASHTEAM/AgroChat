Sorghum is a staple crop. Sorghum globulus is a subspecies of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), which is a cereal grain that is widely cultivated for food and animal feed in many parts of the world1. The type of disease of this disease is a fungal disease. Sorghum globulus leaf spot is caused by the fungus <em>Ascochyta sorghi</em>, which belongs to the class Dothideomycetes2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia. <em>Ascochyta sorghi</em> produces dark brown to black conidia (spores) that are oval to oblong in shape and have transverse septa. The conidia are produced in chains on short conidiophores that emerge from the stomata or through the epidermis of the infected plant parts2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are as follows: Epidemiological pattern: The disease appears as small reddish spots on the leaves that gradually swell and develop into small black pustules, mainly visible on the upper leaf surface. As they eventually break off, they leave white craters with black surroundings. The spots may coalesce to form large necrotic areas that reduce the photosynthetic capacity and yield potential of the plant2 4. The primary infection is by means of conidia present in the crop residues or soil that germinate and infect the young leaves through wounds or natural openings. Secondary spread is by air-borne conidia that are dispersed by wind or rain splashes and infect new leaves or plants2 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually during the vegetative or early reproductive stages of the plant growth, when the environmental conditions are favorable for the fungal infection2 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are as follows: The optimum temperature range for the fungal growth and infection is 20-25 В°C, although it can occur at temperatures as low as 10 В°C or as high as 30 В°C2 3. High humidity (above 80%) favors the infection via the spores produced in the pustules. Frequent rains or dews also promote the disease development2 3. The fungus can survive in the soil or crop residues for several years, especially in acidic soils with low organic matter content2 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by means of conidia or mycelium present in the soil or crop residues that can survive low temperatures and germinate when favorable conditions return2 3.
The use of fungicides such as copper-based compounds or triazoles can reduce the severity of the disease and increase the yield of sorghum1. However, chemical control is not very effective and may pose environmental and health risks2. The use of fungicides should be based on disease forecasting and economic threshold levels.
The removal of infected plant parts and the destruction of crop residues can reduce the inoculum sources and prevent the spread of the disease2. However, this method is labor-intensive and may not be feasible for large-scale production.
The use of antagonistic microorganisms such as <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em>, or <em>Pseudomonas fluorescen</em>s can suppress the growth and infection of <em>Glochidium sorghi</em> by producing antibiotics, enzymes, or volatile compounds2 . However, biological control is not very consistent and may be affected by environmental factors.
The use of disease-free seeds, resistant varieties, crop rotation, intercropping, proper spacing, weed management, and timely irrigation can enhance the resistance of sorghum plants and reduce the disease incidence and severity2 . This method is considered the most effective, environment-friendly, and cheap method of disease control2.
["The infected leaves show circular to irregular brown to black spots with yellow halos that coalesce to form large necrotic areas. The spots may have grayish centers with dark margins. The infected leaves may curl, dry up, and fall off prematurely2 .", "The infected stems show dark brown to black lesions that girdle the stem and cause wilting and death of the plant2.", "The infected heads show brown to black spots that enlarge and cover the entire head surface. The heads may become sterile or produce shriveled and discolored seeds2 ."]
["The presence of dark brown to black conidia (spores) of Glochidium sorghi on the surface of infected plant parts. The conidia are oval to oblong in shape and have transverse septa. They are produced in chains on short conidiophores that emerge from the stomata or through the epidermis of the infected plant parts2 .", "The presence of whitish to grayish mycelium (fungal threads) of Glochidium sorghi on the surface or inside the infected plant parts. The mycelium is septate and branched and may form sclerotia (hardened masses) in some cases2 ."]
Resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: The resistance of sorghum plants to <em>Glochidium sorghi</em> is mainly based on the hypersensitive response (HR), which is a rapid cell death at the site of infection that prevents the spread of the pathogen1. The HR is mediated by the recognition of pathogen effectors by plant resistance (R) genes2. The resistance agent for sorghum leaf spot is the R gene that encodes a protein that can detect the presence of Glochidium sorghi and trigger the HR. A major recessive resistance gene ds1 on chromosome 5 was identified as a loss of function allele of a gene encoding a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase3. Other QTL for leaf spot resistance have been identified on chromosomes 6 and 94. The level of resistance to sorghum leaf spot varies depending on the genotype, environment, and pathogen isolate. Some cultivars show complete resistance to certain isolates, while others show partial or no resistance. The resistance level can also be affected by temperature, humidity, and plant growth stage1 4. 
Quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: One possible quick test method for Glochidium sorghi is to use a specific DNA probe or PCR primer that can hybridize with the genomic DNA of the fungus and produce a detectable signal. This method can be performed on infected plant tissues or seeds and can provide a rapid and accurate diagnosis of the disease. Another possible quick test method for Glochidium sorghi is to use a serological assay such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) that can detect the presence of fungal antigens or antibodies in plant sap or seed extracts. This method can also provide a fast and reliable diagnosis of the disease. 
Mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease: Pathogenic effectors are molecules secreted by pathogens that can manipulate host defenses or physiology. <em>Glochidium sorghi</em> produces several types of effectors, such as toxins, enzymes, and small secreted proteins (SSPs). The exact number and function of these effectors are not well known, but some examples include glochidiol (a toxin that inhibits photosynthesis), endopolygalacturonase (an enzyme that degrades cell wall pectin), and Gs1 (an SSP that induces host cell death). <em>Glochidium sorghi </em>can infect various plants belonging to different families, such as Poaceae (sorghum), Asteraceae (sunflower), Brassicaceae (mustard), Fabaceae (soybean), Malvaceae (cotton), Solanaceae (tomato), etc.. However, the degree and pattern of infestation may vary depending on the host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, and environmental conditions. For example, sorghum is more susceptible to <em>Glochidium sorghi</em> than sunflower, and leaf spot symptoms are more common on sorghum than on other hosts .
