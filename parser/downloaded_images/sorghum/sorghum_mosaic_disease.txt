Sorghum is a staple crop that is widely grown for food, feed, and biofuel production1 2. Sorghum mosaic disease is caused by viruses in the family Potyviridae, such as sorghum mosaic virus (SrMV), sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV), and Johnsongrass mosaic virus (JGMV)1 2 3.
The viruses that cause sorghum mosaic disease reproduce by replicating their RNA genomes inside the host plant cells using viral-encoded proteins3. They do not produce spores or conidia. The viruses that cause sorghum mosaic disease are transmitted by aphids in a nonpersistent manner, meaning that the aphids acquire and inoculate the virus within a short period of time4 2. The viruses can also be transmitted through seed at a low rate (\&lt; 0.5%)1.
The period of disease onset for sorghum mosaic disease depends on the time of infection, the virus strain, and the host genotype2. Generally, the disease symptoms appear 7 to 14 days after infection5. The environmental conditions required for sorghum mosaic disease are warm and humid climates, which favor aphid activity and virus multiplication2 5. The optimal temperature range for virus infection is 20 to 30Г‚В°C5.
The overwintering method of sorghum mosaic disease is through perennial hosts such as Johnsongrass, sugarcane, and other grasses that harbor the virus throughout the year2 5.
There is no effective chemical control for this disease. Insecticides may reduce the aphid vectors that transmit the virus, but they are not economical or practical1.
Infected plants or plant parts should be removed and destroyed to prevent further spread of the disease1.
There is no known biological control for this disease.
The following practices may help prevent or reduce the disease1 2: Plant resistant or tolerant varieties of sorghum. Avoid planting sorghum near sugarcane, maize, Johnsongrass or other grassy weeds that may harbor the virus or the aphid vectors. Use virus-free seed and equipment. Rotate crops with non-host plants such as legumes or cotton.
["The disease symptoms are mosaic patterns of contrasting shades of green on the leaves, resulting from varying levels of chlorophyll concentration in the leaf blade3 4.", "The mosaic patterns may be fine discontinuous chlorotic streaks between the veins, or irregular blotches or mottles on the leaf surface1 4.", "The lesions may become necrotic as the disease progresses1.", "Infected plants may become stunted in growth with short internodes1.", "An early-infected plant may die sooner or later without emergence of earhead1.", "The disease may also affect the grain yield and quality by reducing the size and weight of the kernels1."]
["The disease signs are the presence of viral particles or antigens in the infected tissue, which can be detected by electron microscopy, serological tests, or molecular techniques1 2.", "The virus can be isolated from the infected tissue and inoculated to indicator plants such as maize, oat, or barley for identification1."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of sorghum mosaic disease is not a fungus, but a virus. Sorghum mosaic disease is caused by Sorghum mosaic virus (SrMV), which belongs to the family Potyviridae1. SrMV infects sorghum and other poaceous plants, causing mosaic symptoms and stunting1. I could not find any information on the mechanism of resistance, the type of resistance agent, or the level of resistance of SrMV in the search results. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic virus of sorghum mosaic disease is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA can detect SrMV in sorghum leaf samples using specific antibodies1. ELISA is a sensitive and reliable technique that can be performed in a few hours1. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of sorghum mosaic disease is virus replication and movement. SrMV enters the plant cells through aphid feeding and replicates its RNA genome using the host machinery1. The virus then moves from cell to cell through plasmodesmata, and from leaf to leaf through phloem1. SrMV produces several pathogenic effectors, such as coat protein, helper component-proteinase, and cylindrical inclusion protein, that modulate the host defense and facilitate the infection1. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host susceptibility and resistance genes, as well as the virus strain and isolate1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic virus of sorghum mosaic disease are host factors that are essential for virus infection. For example, some studies have identified eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) as potential targets for SrMV infection2. eIFs are involved in the translation of viral RNA and are required for virus replication2. Knocking out or silencing these genes could reduce or prevent SrMV infection in sorghum plants2.
