Sorghum is a type of cereal crop that can be used for food, feed, and fuel1 2. It can also be considered as a staple food in some regions where it is a major source of carbohydrates1. Bacterial streak disease of sorghum is caused by a bacterium called <em>Pseudomonas andropogoni</em>1 3 4. It is the most common bacterial disease of sorghum1.
Since the causal organism of this disease is a bacterium, it does not have a fungal mode of reproduction. Bacteria reproduce by binary fission, which is a process of splitting into two identical cells. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are not well documented, but some possible factors are: The bacterium can survive on infected plant debris and seeds5. The bacterium can be spread by wind, rain, irrigation water, insects, and mechanical tools3. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions1 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease is not clearly defined, but some sources suggest that it can occur at any stage of plant growth3 . However, the disease may be more noticeable during the vegetative and flowering stages3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are: High temperature (above 25В°C) and high humidity (above 80%)1 3. Wet weather or frequent irrigation1 3. Susceptible varieties of sorghum1 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is not well studied, but some possible ways are: The bacterium can survive on infected plant debris and seeds in the soil3. The bacterium can infect alternative hosts such as Johnsongrass and other grasses3 .
Applying copper-based bactericides, such as copper hydroxide or copper oxychloride, can reduce the severity of the disease1. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the environmental conditions1. The control effect may vary depending on the susceptibility of the sorghum variety and the level of infection1.
Removing and destroying infected plant parts or residues can reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease1. However, this may not be feasible or economical in large-scale production1.
Using antagonistic microorganisms, such as <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> or <em>Pseudomonas fluorescen</em>s, can inhibit the growth and activity of the pathogen1. These biocontrol agents can be applied as seed treatments or foliar sprays1. The effectiveness of biological control may depend on the compatibility and survival of the biocontrol agents in the field1.
Practicing crop rotation with non-host crops, such as legumes or oilseeds, can reduce the soil-borne inoculum and break the disease cycle1. Avoiding planting sorghum near johnsongrass or other grassy weeds that can harbor the pathogen can also reduce the risk of infection1. Planting resistant or tolerant sorghum varieties is another important strategy for managing the disease1.
["These stripes are confined between the veins and may have a crusty surface when the bacterial slime dries on the surface2 3.", "The stripes may coalesce and cause leaf blighting and premature defoliation3.", "The disease may also affect the panicles and cause reduced grain filling and quality3."]

Bacterial streak disease of sorghum is caused by the bacterium; <em>Pseudomonas andropogoni</em>1 2. This bacterium can develop resistance to some antibiotics, such as streptomycin and tetracycline, by acquiring plasmids or transposons that carry resistance genes3. The level of resistance depends on the frequency and intensity of antibiotic use, the genetic diversity of the bacterial population, and the environmental conditions3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacterium of bacterial streak disease is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies to detect the presence of the bacterium in plant tissues3. This method is rapid, simple, and reliable, and can be performed in the field or in the laboratory3. Another test method is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which amplifies specific DNA sequences of the bacterium from plant samples3. This method is more sensitive and specific than ELISA, but requires more equipment and expertise3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of bacterial streak disease is not fully understood, but it involves several factors, such as bacterial multiplication, bacterial movement, bacterial secretion, infection, and colonization3. The bacterium multiplies on the leaf surface or in the intercellular spaces of the leaf tissue3. The bacterium moves along the leaf veins or through natural openings or wounds3. The bacterium secretes enzymes, toxins, or polysaccharides that degrade plant cell walls, interfere with plant metabolism, or protect the bacterium from plant defense responses3. The bacterium infects and colonizes the leaf tissue, causing necrotic streaks that reduce photosynthesis and yield3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors that the bacterium uses to manipulate plant defense responses are not well known, but some candidates have been identified by genomic and proteomic analyses3. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host susceptibility, which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacterium of bacterial streak disease are also unclear, as there are few studies on this topic. One possible target is the plant cell wall, which is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin, and other components3. The bacterium may produce enzymes that degrade these components and facilitate its entry and colonization3. Another possible target is the plant sugar transport system, which regulates the movement of sugars from source to sink tissues3. The bacterium may interfere with this system and divert sugars for its own growth and survival3.
