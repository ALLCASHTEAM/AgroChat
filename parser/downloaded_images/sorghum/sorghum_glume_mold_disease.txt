Sorghum is a staple crop that is cultivated for its edible grains, forage, and biofuel1. Sorghum coal blotch is a fungal disease that is caused by Bipolaris sorghicola2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of sorghum coal blotch is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in dark brown to black conidiophores2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of sorghum coal blotch are influenced by the presence and dispersal of conidia, which can be spread by wind, rain, or irrigation water2 3. The disease can also be transmitted through infected seeds or plant debris2 3.
The period of disease onset for sorghum coal blotch may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the stage of plant growth. Generally, the symptoms appear more severe when the plants are infected at early stages of growth or under high humidity and moderate temperature2 3. The symptoms include elliptical, straw-colored, necrotic lesions with darker margins on the leaves2 3. The environmental conditions required for sorghum coal blotch are favorable for conidial production and infection. These include high humidity, moderate temperature (20 to 30Г‚В°C), and frequent rainfall or irrigation2 3. The disease is more prevalent in humid and tropical regions2 3.
The overwintering method of sorghum coal blotch is mainly through infected seeds or plant debris that can serve as sources of inoculum for the next season2 3. The fungus can also survive in alternative hosts or weeds that can harbor conidia during winter2 3.
The use of fungicides such as propiconazole, tebuconazole, or azoxystrobin can reduce the severity of the disease and increase the yield of sorghum1. However, chemical control is not very effective and may pose environmental and health risks2. The use of fungicides should be based on disease forecasting and economic threshold levels3.
The removal of infected plant parts and the destruction of crop residues can reduce the inoculum sources and prevent the spread of the disease2. However, this method is labor-intensive and may not be feasible for large-scale production.
The use of antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, or Pseudomonas fluorescens can suppress the growth and infection of Bipolaris sorghicola by producing antibiotics, enzymes, or volatile compounds2 . However, biological control is not very consistent and may be affected by environmental factors.
The use of disease-free seeds, resistant varieties, crop rotation, intercropping, proper spacing, weed management, and timely irrigation can enhance the resistance of sorghum plants and reduce the disease incidence and severity2 . This method is considered the most effective, environment-friendly, and cheap method of disease control2.
["The infected leaves show elliptical to irregular brown to black spots with yellow halos that coalesce to form large necrotic areas. The spots may have grayish centers with dark margins. The infected leaves may curl, dry up, and fall off prematurely2 3.", "The infected stems show dark brown to black lesions that girdle the stem and cause wilting and death of the plant2.", "The infected heads show brown to black spots that enlarge and cover the entire head surface. The heads may become sterile or produce shriveled and discolored seeds2 3."]
["The presence of dark brown to black conidia (spores) of Bipolaris sorghicola on the surface of infected plant parts. The conidia are oval to oblong in shape and have transverse septa. They are produced in chains on short conidiophores that emerge from the stomata or through the epidermis2 3.", "The presence of whitish to grayish mycelium (fungal threads) of Bipolaris sorghicola on the surface or inside the infected plant parts. The mycelium is septate and branched and may form sclerotia (hardened masses) in some cases2 3."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of sorghum coal blotch disease is Sclerotinia sclerotiorum1, which can cause white mold disease in over 400 plant species1. This fungus can detoxify plant glucosinolates by using a sulfatase enzyme that cleaves off the sulfate group and renders them harmless1. This mechanism of resistance allows the fungus to colonize plants that produce glucosinolates, such as Brassicaceae and Capparaceae1. The level of resistance depends on the type and amount of glucosinolates in the host plant, as well as the expression and activity of the sulfatase enzyme in the fungus1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of sorghum coal blotch disease is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that can detect and identify the fungal DNA from infected plant tissues. This method requires extracting DNA from the samples, amplifying a specific region of the fungal genome using primers, and analyzing the PCR products by gel electrophoresis or sequencing. This method is rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable for diagnosing sorghum coal blotch disease. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of sorghum coal blotch disease is to produce sclerotia, which are hard, black, resting structures that can survive in soil or plant debris for long periods. The sclerotia germinate under favorable conditions and produce apothecia, which are cup-shaped structures that release ascospores, which are airborne spores that can infect plant tissues through wounds or natural openings. The fungus then grows inside the plant and causes symptoms such as wilting, necrosis, and white mold. The fungus can also produce oxalic acid, which is a pathogenic effector that degrades plant cell walls and suppresses plant defense responses. The fungus can infect different plants depending on their susceptibility, environmental factors, and cropping practices. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of sorghum coal blotch disease are not clear, as there is no evidence of bacterial involvement in this disease. However, some studies have suggested that Pseudomonas syringae may cause bacterial leaf spot or stripe on sorghum, but this is usually a minor disease that does not cause significant yield losses. The bacteria may use type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into plant cells and manipulate their physiology and immunity. Some of these effectors may be lethal if knocked out or overexpressed in plants, such as AvrPtoB, HopZ1a, HopAM1, and HopG1.
