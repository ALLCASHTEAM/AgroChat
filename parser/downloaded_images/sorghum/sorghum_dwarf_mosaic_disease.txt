Sorghum is a type of staple crop that is grown for food, feed, and fuel purposes. Sorghum is an important cereal crop in many parts of the world, especially in Africa and Asia, where it is a major source of calories and protein for millions of people1. Sorghum dwarf mosaic disease is a type of viral disease that is caused by maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV)2. MDMV is a member of the genus Potyvirus and the family Potyviridae2. MDMV infects several grass species, including maize, sorghum, Johnsongrass, and sugarcane2.
The pathogenic virus of sorghum dwarf mosaic disease does not have a fungus associated with it. Therefore, there is no mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease. However, the virus itself can replicate inside the host plant cells using its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme2. The virus produces flexuous rod-shaped particles that contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of sorghum dwarf mosaic disease are influenced by several factors, such as the presence of alternative hosts, environmental conditions, and vector populations3. The virus can be transmitted by aphids in a non-persistent manner, meaning that the aphids can acquire and transmit the virus within a short time and do not retain the virus for long periods2. The virus can also be transmitted by seed, although this is less common and depends on the seed source and quality2. The virus can also spread by mechanical inoculation, such as through tools or machinery that come in contact with infected plant sap2.
The period of disease onset for sorghum dwarf mosaic disease depends on the time of infection and the susceptibility of the host plant. Generally, infection at an early stage of plant growth can cause more severe symptoms and yield losses than infection at a later stage2. Symptoms usually appear within 7 to 14 days after infection4. Symptoms include mosaic, red leaf, red stripe, and necrosis on the leaves and stems of sorghum plants2 4 5 6. Infected plants may also show stunting, excess tillering, delayed flowering, and reduced grain production2 4 5 6. The environmental conditions required for sorghum dwarf mosaic disease are favorable for both the virus and its vector. The virus can survive in a wide range of temperatures, but it prefers warm and humid conditions for optimal replication and movement within the host plant2. The aphid vector also thrives in warm and moist conditions, and its population can increase rapidly under such conditions2. The virus can also survive in alternative hosts, such as Johnsongrass and other grass weeds, which can serve as sources of inoculum and reservoirs for the virus2.
The overwintering method of sorghum dwarf mosaic disease is mainly through alternative hosts or infected seeds. The virus can persist in perennial grasses, such as Johnsongrass, that can survive the winter season and act as sources of infection for the next crop season2. The virus can also be carried over by infected seeds that germinate in the spring and produce symptomatic plants2.
The use of insecticides such as carbaryl, malathion, or dimethoate can reduce the population of aphids, which are the main vectors of the virus that causes the disease1. However, chemical control is not very effective and may pose environmental and health risks2. The use of insecticides should be based on aphid monitoring and economic threshold levels.
The removal of infected plant parts and the destruction of crop residues can reduce the inoculum sources and prevent the spread of the disease2. However, this method is labor-intensive and may not be feasible for large-scale production.
The use of natural enemies such as ladybugs, lacewings, or parasitic wasps can suppress the population of aphids and reduce the transmission of the virus2 . However, biological control is not very consistent and may be affected by environmental factors.
The use of disease-free seeds, resistant varieties, crop rotation, intercropping, proper spacing, weed management, and timely irrigation can enhance the resistance of sorghum plants and reduce the disease incidence and severity2 . This method is considered the most effective, environment-friendly, and cheap method of disease control2.
["The infected leaves show fine discontinuous chlorotic streaks between the veins that may become necrotic as the disease progresses. The infected plants become stunted in growth with short internodes. An early-infected plant may die sooner or later without emergence of earhead3 4.", "The infected leaves show reddish stripes along the veins that may turn necrotic. The infected plants show reduced tillering and delayed flowering3 4.", "The infected leaves show reddish streaks along the midrib that may extend to the leaf margins. The infected plants show reduced growth and yield3 4.", "The infected leaves show brown to black necrotic spots or patches that may cause leaf death. The infected plants show severe stunting and wilting3 4."]
["The presence of spherical to rod-shaped virus particles of Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) in the cytoplasm of infected plant cells. The virus particles are about 28 nm in diameter and 750 nm in length. They are composed of a single-stranded RNA genome and a protein coat3 4.", "The presence of winged or wingless aphids on the surface or underside of infected plant parts. Aphids are small insects that feed on plant sap and transmit the virus from plant to plant. Several species of aphids can act as vectors of MDMV, such as Rhopalosiphum maidis (corn leaf aphid), Schizaphis graminum (greenbug), Melanaphis sacchari (sugarcane aphid), etc.3 4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of sorghum dwarf foliar disease, also known as target leaf spot, is not well understood. However, some studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to the disease in sorghum1. One QTL on chromosome 6 was also associated with resistance to two other diseases, zonate leaf spot and drechslera leaf blight1. Another study found that variation in the response to the microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) flg22, a derivative of flagellin, was not linked to variation in target leaf spot resistance1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of sorghum dwarf foliar disease is to use a diagnostic kit based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These methods can detect the presence of the fungus Bipolaris cookei (also known as Bipolaris sorghicola) in sorghum tissues or seeds2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of sorghum dwarf foliar disease is not fully elucidated. However, some studies have suggested that the fungus Bipolaris cookei produces toxins and enzymes that degrade the plant cell wall and cause necrosis and chlorosis of the leaves2. The fungus also produces spores that can spread by wind or rain and infect new plants2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors and their differences in infestation of different plants are not well characterized. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of sorghum dwarf foliar disease are unknown. However, some studies have reported that some genes involved in plant defense, such as PR1, PR2, PR5, WRKY33, and EDS1, are differentially expressed in sorghum plants infected by Bipolaris cookei2. These genes may be involved in modulating the plant immune response to the bacterial infection.
