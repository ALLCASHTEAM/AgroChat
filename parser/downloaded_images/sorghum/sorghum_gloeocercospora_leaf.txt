Sorghum is a cereal crop that can be used for food, feed, fuel, and industrial purposes1. It is considered a staple crop in some regions of the world, especially Africa and Asia2. Sorghum leopard disease is a fungal disease caused by Cercospora sorghi3. It is also known as sorghum leaf blight or target spot.
The pathogenic fungus reproduces by producing conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or rain3 . The disease is favored by warm (75 to 80 degrees F), moist weather and high humidity. The conidia infect the leaves through natural openings or wounds, and cause circular to oval lesions that are tan to gray in the center and reddishbrown at the margin3 . The lesions may coalesce and cover large areas of the leaf surface, reducing photosynthesis and grain yield3 . The fungus can survive on infected plant debris or seed3.
The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common and severe during the late vegetative and reproductive stages3 . The disease requires warm (75 to 80 degrees F), moist weather and high humidity for infection and development. The disease is more severe on plants that are stressed by drought, nutrient deficiency, insect damage, or other diseases3 .
The fungus can overwinter on infected plant debris or seed in the soil3.
The epidemic year or individual susceptible fields, from the pregnancy spike from the beginning of spraying pharmaceutical control. The agent can choose 50% carbendazim wettable powder 800 times liquid, or 70% metribuzin wettable powder 1,000 times liquid, or 50% benomyl wettable powder 1,500 times liquid, or 25% charitin wettable powder 500 times liquid.


Seed treatment: Before sowing, use 0.5% of the seed weight of 50% fumet or 50% carbendazim wettable powder to mix the seed. (2) Agricultural prevention and control: the implementation of large-scale crop rotation, the application of fully rotted organic fertilizer, appropriate fertilizer, so that the late not off the fertilizer, to enhance plant disease resistance. After harvest, timely treatment of disease residues, deep turning, turning the disease residues into the deep soil to reduce the initial source of infection.
["It mainly affects leaves and leaf sheaths. The first purple-red suborbicular or oval spots, variable in size, with two to eight very obvious whorls. Usually easy to occur at the edge of the leaf, the spot into a semi-elliptic. When the weather is humid, the back surface of the spot produces slender orange-red mucilage, that is, the conidiophore and conidia of the pathogen. In severe cases, the spots converge and resemble "leopard stripes," causing the leaves to die. Many sorghum varieties do not have typical whorls on the leaves, but produce dark purple patches of varying sizes and irregular shapes that are not easy to recognize."]

Sorghum leopard disease is caused by a fungus called Cercospora sorghi1. This fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as benzimidazoles and strobilurins2. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the genes encoding for the target enzymes of the fungicides, such as beta-tubulin and cytochrome b2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide dose, the fungal strain, and the environmental conditions2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of sorghum leopard disease is to use a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI)3. This method uses a strip coated with antibodies that can detect fungal antigens in plant samples. The strip produces a color change when the antigens are present, indicating a positive result3. This method is rapid, simple, and sensitive, and can be used in the field or in the laboratory3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of sorghum leopard disease is to produce conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or rain to infect new host plants1. The conidia germinate on the leaf surface and penetrate the cuticle and epidermis with a specialized structure called an appressorium4. The fungus then grows inside the leaf tissue and produces toxins that cause necrotic lesions on the leaves4. The fungus also produces effector proteins that modulate the plant immune response and facilitate infection5. The type and number of effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain and the host plant species5. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of sorghum leopard disease are not well known, as this disease is mainly caused by a fungus. However, some studies have suggested that some genes involved in plant defense may be important for resistance to Cercospora sorghi infection6 . For example, a gene called ARG1 (Anthracnose Resistance Gene 1) was found to confer broad resistance to fungal diseases, including sorghum leopard disease, in sorghum plants6. Another gene called SbPR1 (Sorghum bicolor Pathogenesis-Related 1) was found to be induced by Cercospora sorghi infection and to enhance resistance to fungal pathogens in transgenic plants.
