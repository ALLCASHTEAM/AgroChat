Sorghum is a staple crop that is widely grown for food, feed, and fuel1 2. Sorghum target spot disease is a fungal disease caused by the necrotrophic fungus Bipolaris cookei (also known as Bipolaris sorghicola)1 2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in pycnidia (small flask-shaped structures) on the infected leaves1 2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and leaf wetness. The fungus can survive on crop residues and infect new plants through winddispersed conidia or rain-splashed inoculum1 2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the host plant. The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more severe during the grain filling stage1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid climates, with temperatures ranging from 20Г‚В°C to 30Г‚В°C and relative humidity above 80%. The disease is favored by frequent rainfall and prolonged leaf wetness1 2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on crop residues in the soil or on alternative hosts, such as wild grasses or weeds1 2.
Fungicides such as propiconazole, azoxystrobin, and pyraclostrobin can be applied to reduce the severity of the disease and protect the yield potential of the crop1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease pressure. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance level of the hybrid1 2.
Cutting off or burning the infected parts of the plant can help reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease1 3. However, this may not be feasible or economical in large-scale production1 3.
There is limited information on the use of biological agents to control sorghum target spot disease. Some studies have reported that antagonistic bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens can inhibit the growth of Bipolaris cookei in vitro, but their efficacy and safety in field conditions need further evaluation.
This involves the use of cultural practices that can reduce the favorable conditions for the disease development, such as crop rotation, resistant hybrids, weed management, balanced fertilization, proper irrigation, and timely harvest1 3 4. These practices can enhance the plant health and vigor, and lower the disease incidence and severity1 3 4.
["The disease initially appears as small, circular, brown to tan spots on the lower leaves of the plant1 3 4.", "The spots enlarge and coalesce, forming irregular-shaped lesions with dark brown margins and gray centers1 3 4.", "The lesions may have concentric rings or a target-like appearance, giving the disease its name1 3 4.", "The infected leaves may turn yellow, dry up, and fall off prematurely, resulting in defoliation and reduced photosynthesis1 3 4.", "The disease can also affect the leaf sheaths, stalks, and panicles of the plant, causing discoloration, rotting, and poor grain filling1 3 4."]
["The presence of pycnidia (small flask-shaped structures) on the surface of the lesions that produce conidia (asexual spores) of the fungus1 3 4.", "The conidia are hyaline to pale brown, oblong to cylindrical, with 4 to 8 septa (cross-walls) and a dark scar at each end1 3 4.", "The conidia can be observed under a microscope or by using a hand lens on a moistened leaf sample1 3 4\\^."]
Sorghum target spot disease is caused by a fungus called Bipolaris cookei (also known as Bipolaris sorghicola)1. This fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as triazoles and strobilurins2. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the genes encoding for the target enzymes of the fungicides, such as CYP51 and cytochrome b2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide dose, the fungal strain, and the environmental conditions2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of sorghum target spot disease is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)3. This method uses specific primers that can amplify a DNA fragment from the fungal genome in plant samples. The amplified DNA fragment can be detected by gel electrophoresis or a fluorescent probe3. This method is rapid, specific, and sensitive, and can be used in the field or in the laboratory3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of sorghum target spot disease is to produce conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or rain to infect new host plants4. The conidia germinate on the leaf surface and penetrate the cuticle and epidermis with a specialized structure called an appressorium4. The fungus then grows inside the leaf tissue and produces toxins that cause necrotic lesions on the leaves4. The fungus also produces effector proteins that modulate the plant immune response and facilitate infection5. The type and number of effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain and the host plant species5. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of sorghum target spot disease are not well known, as this disease is mainly caused by a fungus. However, some studies have suggested that some genes involved in plant defense may be important for resistance to Bipolaris cookei infection6 . For example, a gene called SbMLO1 (Sorghum bicolor Mildew Resistance Locus O 1) was found to confer resistance to fungal diseases, including sorghum target spot disease, in sorghum plants6. Another gene called SbWRKY40 (Sorghum bicolor WRKY Transcription Factor 40) was found to be induced by Bipolaris cookei infection and to enhance resistance to fungal pathogens in transgenic plants.
