Cherry is a type of horticultural crop that belongs to the genus Prunus1 2. Cherry bacterial perforation disease is a type of bacterial disease caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas pruni1 3.
The pathogenic bacterium of this disease does not have a fungal mode of reproduction, as it is not a fungus. Bacteria reproduce by binary fission, which is a process of splitting into two identical cells. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by rainfall, wind, frost, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in the margins of cankers or infected buds and ooze out during wet periods. They enter the plant through natural openings or wounds and cause leaf spots, fruit lesions, and cankers4 5.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually in the spring, when the weather is cool and wet and the new leaves and buds are expanding1 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool temperatures, high humidity, and poor soil drainage. These factors increase the susceptibility of the plant to infection and the survival of the bacteria3 5.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in cankers or buds on the plant or in fallen leaves on the ground1 3.
The use of fungicides may help prevent or slow down the disease development, but they will not work if the leaf spot is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas pruni. Fungicide applications should start as the new leaves are expanding and continue while rainy periods persist1. Research out of Oregon has shown using an application of 10% lime sulfur starting at leaf drop (September Гўв‚¬вЂњ October) is very helpful controlling the disease for the coming season.
Pruning and disposing of infected branches, twigs, buds, leaves, and fruit can reduce the inoculum and prevent further spread of the disease. Pruning tools should be disinfected between prunings to avoid transmitting the bacteria1 2. Pruning is best done after harvest during the summer when conditions are hot and dry1.
There is no effective biological control agent for this disease.
Planting resistant varieties, such as Prunus 'First Lady' or Prunus 'Dream Catcher', can reduce the susceptibility to the disease1. Adjusting tree and shrub spacing and using proper pruning can provide better air circulation and promote faster leaf drying1. Applying proper nitrogen fertilization and using drip or microsprinkler irrigation can enhance tree vigor and nutrient uptake3. Avoiding frost injury, cold stress, and soil compaction can also reduce the risk of infection1 2.
["Leaf spots: Brown or reddish-brown spots on leaves that may drop out, leaving small вЂњshot holesвЂќ1 4.", "Leaf wilting and yellowing: Leaves and shoot growth beyond a canker may wilt and die during the growing season when cankers girdle a branch or the trunk. Infected cherry tree leaves will turn completely yellow and drop from the trees in mid-summer if the infection is severe1 4.", "Fruit lesions: Deep, black depressions on fruit or fruit stems1 4.", "Cankers: Darkened, sunken areas on branches, twigs, or trunks that may ooze gum1 4."]
["Bacterial ooze: A slimy substance that exudes from cankers or infected buds during wet periods1 3.", "Bacterial flecks and pockets: Small dots or patches of bacterial invasion in bark that occur outside canker margins3."]
Mechanism of resistance: The bacterium may have mechanisms to evade or suppress the host defense responses, such as producing toxins, enzymes, or effectors that interfere with plant signaling pathways or cell wall integrity1. Type of resistance agent: The bacterium may have resistance to some chemical agents, such as copper compounds, that are commonly used to control bacterial diseases. Copper resistance has been reported in some populations of Pseudomonas syringae in commercial orchards2. Level of resistance: The level of resistance may vary depending on the strain of the bacterium, the environmental conditions, and the host genotype. Resistance may also evolve over time due to genetic mutations or horizontal gene transfer1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is based on the detection of bacterial ooze from cankers or infected buds. The ooze can be collected on a sterile swab and streaked on a nutrient agar plate. The colonies of Pseudomonas syringae can be identified by their morphology, fluorescence under UV light, and biochemical tests3 2. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The bacterium may produce various types of effectors that modulate the host immunity and facilitate infection. Some examples are coronatine, syringomycin, syringopeptin, and type III secretion system effectors1. The number and diversity of effectors may vary depending on the strain of the bacterium and the host species1. Differences in infestation of different plants: The bacterium may have different degrees of host specificity and virulence depending on the plant species or cultivar. Some plants may have innate or acquired resistance to the bacterium, while others may be more susceptible or tolerant1. For example, some cherry cultivars such as Royal Ann, Bing, Lambert, Napoleon, Sweetheart, and Van are very susceptible to bacterial canker, while others such as Corum, Regina, Rainier, Sam, and Sue appear to have sufficient tolerance4. The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease are not well known, but some candidates that may be involved in disease susceptibility or resistance include the following: Knockout lethal genes: These are genes that are essential for plant survival or growth and may be targeted by the bacterium to cause cell death or dysfunction. Some examples are genes involved in photosynthesis, respiration, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, or stress responses1. Defense-related genes: These are genes that are involved in plant immunity or defense responses and may be targeted by the bacterium to evade or suppress them. Some examples are genes involved in pattern recognition receptors, defense hormones, reactive oxygen species, pathogenesis-related proteins, or resistance genes1.
