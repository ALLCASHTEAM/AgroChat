The type of crop of this plant is a horticultural crop1, as cherries are grown for their fruits and ornamental value. The type of disease of this disease is a viral disease1 2 3, caused by different strains of mosaic viruses that infect cherry trees and other plants.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is not applicable, as this disease is not caused by a fungus but by a virus. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are pollen and seeds4 2, grafting1 2, and possibly thrips2 that carry the virus from one tree to another. The virus can also overwinter on perennial weeds and be spread by insects that feed on them2.
The period of disease onset for this disease is spring, when the new leaves emerge and show symptoms such as yellowing, spots, holes, enations, and curling1 2. The symptoms may vary depending on the strain of the virus and the cultivar of the cherry tree1 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are not specific, as the virus can infect cherry trees in different regions and climates. However, some factors that may favor the disease are high humidity, warm temperatures, and poor soil drainage2.
The overwintering method of this disease is dormant buds1 2, where the virus can survive until the next growing season. The virus can also overwinter on perennial weeds2 that host the virus and the insect vectors.
Planting resistant varieties when available or purchasing transplants from a reputable source1 2.
Not saving seeds from infected crops, as the virus can be seed-borne1 2.
Sanitizing tools and equipment before grafting or pruning, as the virus can be transmitted by direct contact1 2.
Removing and destroying infected plants and weeds as soon as possible, as the virus can overwinter on them and spread to other plants1 2 3.

["The disease signs of this disease are how to determine the physical evidence of the pathogen itself on the plant, such as fungal substrates, bacterial secretions, etc. However, for viral diseases like this one, there are no visible signs of the pathogen on the plant. The only way to confirm the presence of the virus is by using laboratory tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not applicable, as this disease is not caused by a fungus but by a virus. However, some cherry cultivars may have genetic resistance to certain strains of mosaic viruses1 2. For example, 'Royal Ann' is resistant to the yellow bud mosaic strain of Tomato ringspot virus2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is not applicable, as this disease is not caused by a bacterium but by a virus. However, some methods to detect the presence of the virus in plant tissues are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)3. These methods require laboratory equipment and reagents and are not suitable for field diagnosis. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is viral infection, where the virus enters the plant cells and replicates its genetic material using the host cell machinery. The virus can then move from cell to cell through plasmodesmata, or from plant to plant through vectors such as insects or seeds3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors of the virus are not known, but some possible candidates are viral proteins that interfere with plant defense responses or manipulate plant metabolism4. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host range and host specificity of the virus, which are determined by the interaction between viral and host factors4. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not applicable, as this disease is not caused by a bacterium but by a virus. However, some potential targets of the virus are plant genes that are involved in resistance or susceptibility to viral infection. For example, knockout lethal genes are genes that are essential for plant
