According to 1, cherry is a horticultural crop that belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is grown for its edible fruits that are consumed fresh or processed into various products such as jams, pies, juices, and wines. According to 2 3 4 1, cherry powdery mildew is a fungal disease caused by Podosphaera clandestina, an obligate biotrophic fungus that belongs to the Erysiphaceae family.
According to 2 3 4 1, the pathogenic fungus of cherry powdery mildew reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are formed in chains on the surface of the fungal growth. The conidia are dispersed by wind or rain and can infect new hosts. The fungus also produces chasmothecia, which are sexual spores that are formed in small spherical structures on the infected plant tissues. The chasmothecia contain ascospores, which are released when the chasmothecia rupture and can also infect new hosts. According to 5 3 4 1, cherry powdery mildew has a polycyclic epidemiological pattern, meaning that it can produce multiple cycles of infection and spore production within a growing season. The mode of transmission of cherry powdery mildew is mainly airborne, as the conidia and ascospores are carried by wind currents and can travel long distances. The disease can also be transmitted by rain splash, as the spores can be washed off the infected plant tissues and land on nearby susceptible hosts.
According to 2 3 4 1, cherry powdery mildew can occur at any stage of plant development, but it is more common and severe on young and succulent tissues such as leaves, shoots, and fruits. The disease usually initiates in spring, soon after bud break and leaf emergence, and can continue throughout the summer until leaf fall. According to 2 3 4 1, cherry powdery mildew thrives in warm, humid, and shady conditions. The optimal temperature range for fungal growth and infection is between 70В°F and 80В°F, and the optimal relative humidity range is between 70% and 90%. The fungus does not need free water to germinate, but high humidity favors spore production and dispersal. Shady areas within the canopy or under tree crotches provide favorable microclimates for the disease.
According to 2 3 4 1, cherry powdery mildew overwinters as chasmothecia on senescent leaves or on the bark of twigs and branches. The chasmothecia are resistant to low temperatures and desiccation and can survive until the next spring, when they release ascospores that initiate new infections.
Fungicides that belong to the quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) group (FRAC 11), such as azoxystrobin, or the demethylation inhibitor (DMI) group (FRAC 3), such as tebuconazole, can be effective against powdery mildew1. However, resistance to these fungicides is possible in fungal populations, so they should be alternated with fungicides that have different modes of action1. The application dose, period, frequency and effectiveness of control may vary depending on the product label and environmental conditions. For example, Quadris Top (azoxystrobin/difenconazole) can be applied at 12-14 fl oz per acre with a 0-day pre-harvest interval (PHI) and a 12-hour restricted entry interval (REI)1. QuiltXcel (azoxystrobin/propiconazole) can be applied at 14 fl oz per acre with a 0-day PHI and a 12-hour REI1. Adament 50WG (tebuconazole/trifloxystrobin) can be applied at 4-8 fl oz per acre with a 1-day PHI and a 120-hour REI1.
Pruning and removing infected leaves and shoots can reduce the inoculum and improve air circulation in the canopy2 3. Sanitation practices such as raking and destroying fallen leaves can also help reduce overwintering chasmothecia2 3.
There is no information on biological control of cherry powdery mildew on the web.
Cultural practices such as selecting resistant cultivars, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, irrigating in the morning, and maintaining adequate spacing between trees can help prevent or reduce powdery mildew infection2 3.
["Superficial, white, weblike growth on leaves, shoots, or fruit1 3.", "Light roughly-circular patches on young leaves2.", "Distortion, curling, puckering, twisting or dropping of infected leaves2 1 3.", "Reduced size, pale color or deformation of new leaves on new shoots2.", "Unmarketable fruit due to the covering of white fungal growth on the cherry surface2."]
["The presence of Podosphaera clandestina, the causal fungus, on the plant tissues1 3. This can be detected by microscopic examination of the fungal structures such as hyphae, conidia and chasmothecia4.", "Chasmothecia are small and hardened overwintering structures that harbor ascospores and lie dormant on senescent leaves or in tree crotches2. They are yellow when newly produced and black when fully mature2."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of cherry powdery mildew is Podosphaera clandestina, an obligate biotrophic fungus that needs living plant tissue to survive1. The fungus overwinters in buds on twigs and as chasmothecia, which are spore-containing structures, on the bark of twigs and branches1 2. The fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) and demethylation inhibitors (DMIs), by mutations in the target genes3. The resistance level may vary depending on the fungal population and the fungicide dose3. 
A quick test for the phytopathogenic fungus of cherry powdery mildew is to look for white, weblike growth on leaves, shoots, or fruit1 2. The fungal growth may appear as superficial, white, circular lesions or patches on either side of the leaf or on the terminal ends of shoots4. The infected leaves may curl upward, blister, or drop prematurely2 4. 
The mechanism of infestation by the phytopathogenic fungus of cherry powdery mildew is that the fungal spores are dispersed by wind and germinate on the plant surface under favorable conditions (low rainfall, high humidity, and warm temperatures)1 2. The fungus penetrates the plant epidermis and forms haustoria, which are specialized feeding structures that extract nutrients from the plant cells3. The fungus also produces conidiophores, which are spore-bearing structures that emerge through the stomata and produce secondary spores that can infect new plant tissues3. The fungus may secrete effector molecules that suppress the plant's defense response and facilitate infection3. 
Potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of cherry powdery mildew are not clear from the available information. However, some studies have suggested that disrupting the function of some of the effector molecules or some of the target genes involved in fungal resistance to fungicides may reduce the virulence of the fungus and enhance the susceptibility of the fungus to chemical control3.
