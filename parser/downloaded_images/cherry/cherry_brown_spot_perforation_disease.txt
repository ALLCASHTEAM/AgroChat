Cherry is a type of horticultural crop that produces edible fruits1 2. Cherry brown spot perforation disease is a type of fungal disease caused by the fungus Monilinia fructicola3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in masses on infected fruits and twigs3 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by warm, wet weather and insect vectors. The fungus overwinters in dropped or mummified fruits and infected plant material, and releases conidia in the spring that can infect flowers and young fruits through wounds or natural openings. The infection can spread rapidly during ripening and postharvest storage. Insects such as bees, flies, and moths can also carry conidia from infected to healthy fruits3 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually in the spring, when the flowers and young fruits are susceptible to infection. The symptoms can become more severe as the fruits mature and ripen in the summer3 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, warm temperatures (above 15Г‚В°C), and wetness periods (more than 6 hours) that favor spore germination and infection3 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by forming sclerotia, which are hard, black structures that can survive in the soil or plant debris for several years. Sclerotia can germinate under favorable conditions and produce conidia or apothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) that release ascospores3 4.
Applying fungicides at different stages of the cherry development, such as at bud break, full bloom, petal fall, shuck split, and pre-harvest. The type of fungicide, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product label and the local conditions1 2 3.
Pruning and removing infected twigs, branches, and fruits in summer or fall and destroying them by burning or burying. This can reduce the sources of inoculum for the next season1 4 2 3 5.
Using antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis or Pseudomonas syringae to inhibit the growth or infection of the pathogen1.
Maintaining tree vigor by proper planting, fertilizing, watering, and pruning. Avoiding wounding or injuring the fruits during harvest or storage. Cooling the fruits rapidly after harvest. Using moderate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. Selecting resistant or tolerant cultivars if available1 4 2 3 5.
["Blossom blight: The flowers collapse and brown quickly. Small cankers form on twigs and gum oozes out1 2 3.", "Fruit rot: The ripening fruits brown and shrivel as they become covered with tan to gray masses of spores. The fruits may crack and leak juice. Some fruits may fall while others remain as mummies on the tree1 2 3.", "Twig blight: The infected twigs die back and show brown lesions with gray spore masses. The bark may split and exude gum1 2 3."]
["Conidia: These are asexual spores that are produced in masses on infected fruits and twigs. They are hyaline (translucent), elliptical, and single-celled. They are dispersed by wind or water1 5.", "Sclerotia: These are hard, black structures that can survive in the soil or plant debris for several years. They are composed of compacted fungal hyphae (filaments). They can germinate under favorable conditions and produce conidia or apothecia1 5.", "Apothecia: These are sexual fruiting bodies that release ascospores. They are cup-shaped structures that are formed from sclerotia on the soil surface or on mummified fruits. They are brown to black in color and have a whitish margin1."]
Reduced sensitivity to fungicides: The fungus may have mutations or alterations in the target site or metabolic pathway of the fungicide, resulting in reduced efficacy or increased tolerance1. Detoxification of fungicides: The fungus may have enzymes or transporters that can degrade or efflux the fungicide, reducing its accumulation and toxicity1. Adaptation to environmental stress: The fungus may have genes or pathways that can enhance its survival and fitness under unfavorable conditions, such as temperature, humidity, pH, or nutrient availability1. The type and level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide used and the fungal strain involved1. 
Isolation and identification: The fungus can be isolated from infected plant material and cultured on artificial media. The fungal morphology, growth rate, and spore production can be observed and compared with reference strains2 3. Molecular detection: The fungus can be detected by using specific primers or probes that target its DNA or RNA sequences. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or hybridization techniques can be used to amplify or visualize the fungal nucleic acids2 3. Serological detection: The fungus can be detected by using antibodies that bind to its antigens or proteins. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence techniques can be used to measure or label the fungal antigens2 3. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus may produce various effectors that can manipulate the host defense responses, such as cell wall-degrading enzymes, toxins, suppressors, or modulators4. The number and diversity of effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain and the host genotype4. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus may have different levels of virulence or aggressiveness on different plant species or cultivars, depending on their susceptibility or resistance genes4. The fungus may also have different modes of infection or colonization on different plant tissues or organs, such as flowers, fruits, or twigs4. 
Knockout lethal genes: These are genes that are essential for the fungal growth, development, reproduction, or pathogenicity. Disrupting these genes by mutation or gene editing may result in reduced viability or virulence of the fungus5. Some examples of knockout lethal genes are those involved in DNA replication, cell division, cell wall synthesis, ergosterol biosynthesis, oxidative stress response, signal transduction, or nutrient uptake5.
