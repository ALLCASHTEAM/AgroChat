Rice is a staple crop that provides food for more than half of the world's population1. Rice leaf blast is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae2 3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of rice leaf blast is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or water2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of rice leaf blast are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind. The disease is favored by long periods of free moisture, high humidity, little or no wind at night, and night temperatures between 63 and 73 в„ѓ. Leaf wetness from dew or other sources is required for infection. The optimum day time temperature for spore germination, lesion formation, and sporulation is 77 to 82 в„ѓ5. The conidia are airborne and can infect any above ground part of the rice plant, such as leaf, collar, node, neck, and panicle2 4.
The period of time during which rice leaf blast occurs depends on the growth stage of the rice plant and the environmental conditions. Rice can have blast in all growth stages, but leaf blast incidence tends to lessen as plants mature and develop adult plant resistance to the disease. Leaf blast usually increases early in the season then declines late in the season as leaves become less susceptible. However, neck blast can occur at any time during heading and flowering and can cause severe yield losses2. The environmental conditions required for rice leaf blast are similar to those mentioned in question 4. In addition, the disease is more common in areas with low soil moisture, frequent and prolonged periods of rain shower, and cool temperature in the daytime. In upland rice, large day-night temperature differences that cause dew formation on leaves and overall cooler temperatures favor the development of the disease1 2.
The overwintering method of rice leaf blast is by surviving on alternative hosts such as weeds or volunteer rice plants, or by forming sexual spores called ascospores that can persist in plant debris or soil2 4.
Fungicides such as tricyclazole, propiconazole, azoxystrobin, and isoprothiolane can be effective in reducing the severity and incidence of the disease. The application dose, period, frequency, and effectiveness of these fungicides may vary depending on the product label, environmental conditions, and disease pressure. Always follow the label instructions and safety precautions when using fungicides.
Removing and destroying infected leaves and plant debris can help reduce the inoculum source and prevent the spread of the disease. Draining the field periodically can reduce leaf wetness and fungal dispersal. Burning rice stubble after harvest can eliminate fungal survival structures1.
There are some natural antagonists that can inhibit or suppress the growth and infection of the rice blast fungus. Some examples are bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Streptomyces sp.), fungi (Trichoderma harzianum, Gliocladium virens, Ampelomyces quisqualis), and actinomycetes (Streptomyces sp.). These agents can be applied as seed treatments, soil amendments, or foliar sprays2.
Planting resistant or tolerant varieties of rice can reduce the susceptibility to rice blast. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization can also reduce disease severity. Rotating rice with non-host crops such as legumes or vegetables can break the disease cycle and reduce fungal inoculum1.
["Elliptical or spindle-shaped lesions on the leaves, with whitish to gray centers and brown or reddish brown borders. The lesions are usually 0.39 to 0.58 inch long and 0.12-0.2 inch wide1.", "Coalescence of lesions that may cover large areas of the leaf surface and cause premature defoliation of infected leaves1.", "Reduced growth and yield of the plant due to loss of photosynthetic area and impaired grain filling1."]
["Conidiophores (specialized hyphae) that produce conidia (asexual spores) on the surface of infected leaves. The conidiophores are dark brown, cylindrical, and have a swollen base with a tapered tip3.", "Conidia (asexual spores) that are hyaline (transparent), pyriform (pear-shaped), and have a single septum (cross-wall) dividing them into two cells. The conidia are dispersed by rain splash or wind to new leaves or plants3.", "Appressoria (infection structures) that are formed by germinated conidia on the leaf surface. The appressoria are dome-shaped, melanized (darkened), and have a high internal pressure that allows them to penetrate the leaf cuticle3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of rice leaf blast is mainly based on the mechanism of avirulence (AVR) and resistance (R) gene interaction. The fungus can produce different effectors that can trigger or suppress plant defense responses depending on the presence or absence of corresponding R genes in the rice plant1 2. The type of resistance agent can be either major R genes that confer race-specific resistance or quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that confer partial and durable resistance3. The level of resistance can vary depending on the genetic background of the rice cultivar, the environmental conditions, and the pathogen population3. 
A quick test for the phytopathogenic fungus of rice leaf blast is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that can detect and identify the fungus from infected plant tissues or spores4. The PCR assay can use specific primers that target the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region or other genes of the fungus and amplify them to produce a DNA fragment that can be visualized by gel electrophoresis4 5. 
The mechanism of infestation by the phytopathogenic fungus of rice leaf blast is by producing conidia that land on the rice leaf surface and germinate to form a specialized infection structure called an appressorium. The appressorium generates enormous turgor pressure and penetrates the leaf cuticle with a penetration peg. The penetration peg then grows into a primary hypha that branches into invasive hyphae that colonize the leaf cells and cause lesions1 2. The fungus can produce different types of effectors that can modulate plant defense responses, such as biotrophy-associated secreted proteins (BASPs), avirulence proteins (AVRs), and cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNFs)1 2. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility or incompatibility between the fungal effectors and the plant R genes1 2. 
Researchs find that MGG_ 07012 and MGG_, these two protein kinases 13931 are involved in the sporulation and pathogenic processes of rice blast fungus. In summary, these protein kinases that affect the mycelial growth and sporulation ability, cell wall integrity, and pathogenicity of rice blast fungus can serve as potential drug targets. Chitinase, MGP1, MAGB, and CPKA are four pathogenic genes related to rice blast disease. Knocking out these genes can effectively inhibit the germination and growth of germ tubes, appressoria, and infected hyphae during the infection process of the pathogen
