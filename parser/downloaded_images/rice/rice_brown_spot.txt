The type of crop of rice is a staple crop. It is one of the most widely consumed cereals in the world, especially in Asia and Africa. It provides food and income for millions of farmers and consumers1. The type of disease that causes brown spot on rice is a fungal disease. The causal agent is Bipolaris oryzae (previously known as Helminthosporium oryzae). It is one of the most common and widespread rice diseases2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of the disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in conidiophores (specialized hyphae) on the infected leaves. The conidia are dark brown, oval to cylindrical, and have several septa (cross-walls) dividing them into cells2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of the disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and leaf wetness. The fungus can survive on infected seeds, plant debris, volunteer rice, and weeds. The conidia can be dispersed by rain splash, wind, irrigation water, or farm implements to new leaves or plants3 4.
The period of time during which the disease occurs is mainly in the tillering to ripening stages of the crop. The disease can occur at any growth stage, but it is most severe when infection occurs before flowering or during grain filling2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-35В°C), high humidity (&gt;80%), and prolonged leaf wetness (&gt;12 hours). These conditions favor the germination of conidia and the infection of leaves2 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected seeds or plant debris on the soil surface or in the soil. The fungus can also form sclerotia (hardened masses of fungal tissue) that can withstand unfavorable conditions and resume growth when conditions improve2 4.
Fungicides such as propiconazole, azoxystrobin, and tricyclazole can be applied to control the disease1 2. The dosage, period, frequency, and effectiveness of application may vary depending on the product label, the disease severity, the crop stage, and the environmental conditions. Generally, fungicides are more effective when applied at early stages of infection and when combined with other management practices1 2.
Infected seeds can be soaked in hot water (53В°C) for 10 to 12 minutes or in cold water (20В°C) for eight hours to reduce the fungal inoculum3. Infected plant parts can be removed and destroyed to prevent further spread of the disease1.
Some antagonistic microorganisms such as Trichoderma spp., Bacillus spp., and Pseudomonas spp. have been reported to suppress rice brown spot by competing with or parasitizing the pathogen1 2. However, their efficacy and consistency may depend on several factors such as the strain, the formulation, the application method, and the environmental conditions1 2.
Cultural practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, weed management, residue removal, balanced fertilization, irrigation management, and use of resistant or tolerant varieties can help reduce the disease incidence and severity1 2 3. These practices can enhance the plant health and vigor, improve the soil fertility and drainage, and reduce the inoculum sources and favorable conditions for the disease development1 2 3.

["White to grayish fungal growth on the surface of lesions that consists of conidiophores and conidia (asexual spores) of the pathogen1 2.", "Black spherical structures (chasmothecia) that contain ascospores (sexual spores) of the pathogen on senescent leaves or in plant debris1 2."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus may develop resistance to fungicides by altering the target site of the fungicide, increasing the expression or activity of detoxification enzymes, or reducing the uptake or translocation of the fungicide1. Type of resistance agent: The fungus may develop resistance to different classes of fungicides, such as demethylation inhibitors (DMIs), quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs)1. Level of resistance: The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide class, the fungal population, and the environmental conditions. Some studies have reported moderate to high levels of resistance to QoIs and SDHIs in Bipolaris species causing leaf spot diseases in various crops2 3. However, there is limited information on the level of resistance to fungicides in Bipolaris oryzae causing rice brown spot disease. 
One possible quick test for the fungus is to use a lactophenol cotton blue stain to observe the morphology and characteristics of the fungal structures under a microscope. This stain can help differentiate Bipolaris oryzae from other fungi by showing its conidiophores, conidia, and sclerotia. Another possible quick test for the fungus is to use a molecular diagnostic method such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the specific DNA sequences of the fungus in infected plant samples. These methods can help identify Bipolaris oryzae from other fungi by amplifying its unique genetic markers. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus may produce various types of pathogenic effectors that can manipulate the host defense responses and facilitate infection. Some examples of these effectors are cutinases, pectinases, cellulases, proteases, lipases, glucanases, and necrosis-inducing proteins. The number and diversity of these effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain, the host plant, and the environmental conditions. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus may show different levels of infestation or host specificity depending on the plant species or cultivar. Some plants may have innate or acquired resistance to the fungus, while others may be more susceptible or tolerant. Some factors that may influence the infestation of different plants are plant genotype, plant age, plant health, plant hormones, and plant metabolites. 
One possible target of the fungus is its cell wall biosynthesis pathway, which is essential for its growth, development, and virulence. Inhibiting this pathway may impair the fungal cell wall integrity and function, leading to reduced infection and increased susceptibility to host defenses or fungicides. Another possible target of the fungus is its mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is involved in its energy production, metabolism, and stress response. Inhibiting this chain may disrupt the fungal cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to reduced survival and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress or fungicides.
