Rice is a staple crop that feeds more than half of the world's population1. Rice neck blast is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea or Magnaporthe oryzae2 3.
The fungus reproduces asexually by producing conidia, which are spores that can infect the aerial parts of the rice plant2 3. The disease is transmitted by airborne conidia that land on the rice plant and germinate to form appressoria, which are specialized structures that penetrate the plant tissue2 4.
The disease can occur at any growth stage of the rice plant, but it is most damaging when it infects the neck or node of the panicle, which is the part that holds the grains1 3 5. The disease favors conditions of low soil moisture, frequent and prolonged periods of rain shower, and cool temperature in the daytime1. In upland rice, large day-night temperature differences that cause dew formation on leaves and overall cooler temperatures also favor the disease1.
The fungus can overwinter on infected rice straw, weeds, or alternative hosts such as other grasses2 3.
Adjust planting time. Sow seeds early, when possible, after the onset of the rainy season.
Split nitrogen fertilizer application in two or more treatments. Excessive use of fertilizer can increase blast intensity.
Silicon fertilizers (e.g., calcium silicate) can be applied to soils that are silicon deficient to reduce blast. However, because of its high cost, silicon should be applied efficiently. Cheap sources of silicon, such as straws of rice genotypes with high silicon content, can be an alternative. Care should be taken to ensure that the straw is free from blast as the fungus can survive on rice straw and the use of infected straw as a silicon source can spread the disease further.
Systemic fungicides like triazoles and strobilurins can be used judiciously for control to control blast.
["Lesions on the neck are grayish brown and can cause girdling, making the neck and the panicle fall over1.", "If infection of the neck occurs before milky stage, no grain is formed, but if infection occurs later, poor quality grains are formed1.", "Neck and node blast can also cause whiteheads or white panicles, similar to stem borer infection1."]
["The presence of the fungus Magnaporthe grisea (or Magnaporthe oryzae) on the infected plant parts2.", "The production of conidia (asexual spores) and conidiophores (spore-bearing structures) by the fungus on the lesions2.", "The formation of appressoria (specialized infection structures) by the fungus on the plant surface2."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of rice neck blast is Magnaporthe oryzae (formerly known as Magnaporthe grisea) 1. It has a high degree of genetic diversity and can evolve rapidly to overcome host resistance 1. The mechanism of resistance involves the interaction between fungal avirulence (AVR) genes and plant resistance (R) genes 1. The type of resistance agent can be either qualitative or quantitative, depending on the number and effect of R genes 1. The level of resistance can vary from complete to partial, depending on the environmental conditions and the pathogen population 1. 
A quick test for the phytopathogenic fungus of rice neck blast is the spore suspension inoculation method . This method involves spraying a suspension of fungal spores on rice plants and observing the symptoms after a certain period of time . The symptoms include white to gray-green lesions with darker borders on leaves, stems, nodes, and necks 2 1 3. The lesions can enlarge and coalesce to kill the entire leaf or cause the neck to rot and break 2 1 3. 
The mechanism of infestation by the phytopathogenic fungus of rice neck blast is the formation of appressoria 1 . Appressoria are specialized structures that allow the fungus to penetrate the plant cuticle and cell wall by generating enormous turgor pressure 1 . The type and number of pathogenic effectors are secreted proteins that modulate plant defense responses and facilitate fungal colonization 1 . The differences in infestation of different plants are determined by the specificity of AVR-R gene interactions 1 . Different plants may have different R genes that recognize different AVR genes of the fungus, resulting in compatible or incompatible interactions 1 . 
Potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of rice neck blast are genes involved in appressorium formation and function . For example, knockout lethal genes such as PMK1, MST12, CPKA, and PTH11 are essential for appressorium development and pathogenicity in Magnaporthe oryzae . Other potential targets are genes involved in effector secretion and function . For example, knockout lethal genes such as MGG_01005, MGG_01006, MGG_01007, and MGG_01008 encode secreted proteins that suppress plant immunity and promote fungal virulence in Magnaporthe oryzae .
