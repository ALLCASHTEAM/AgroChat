Zucchini is a type of squash, which is a horticultural crop grown for its edible fruits1 2. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease caused by various species of fungi in the order Erysiphales1 2. The most common species that infects zucchini is Erysiphe cichoracearum3.
The pathogenic fungus of powdery mildew reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that form on the surface of the infected plant parts1 3. The conidia are dispersed by wind, insects, water, or human activity1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of powdery mildew are influenced by several factors, such as temperature, humidity, light, plant age, and plant density4 3. Powdery mildew usually starts as small white circles on the top side of the leaves, and then spreads to other areas of the plant and other plants nearby2. The disease is more severe in warm, dry, and shady conditions, and less severe in hot, wet, and sunny conditions1 3.
The period of disease onset for powdery mildew varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the plant1 3. Powdery mildew can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common and damaging in the late summer and early fall when the temperatures are moderate and the humidity is high1 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are temperatures between 65-80в„‰ with dry surfaces and high air humidity1 2. Powdery mildew spores cannot survive temperatures over 90в„‰, so the disease does not persist in extremely hot weather1. The disease also requires living plant tissue to grow and survive, so it does not affect dead or dormant plants3.
The overwintering method of this disease is through mycelium or cleistothecia3. Mycelium is the vegetative part of the fungus that grows on the infected plant parts and remains dormant until favorable conditions return3. Cleistothecia are sexual structures that form on the mycelium and contain ascospores that can survive for long periods in soil or plant debris3.
Some fungicides that can be used to treat powdery mildew are neem oil1, horticultural oil2, copper or sulfur fungicide2, potassium bicarbonate2, and vinegar2. The type of agent, application dose, application period, application frequency, and control effect may vary depending on the product and the severity of the infection. It is important to follow the label instructions carefully and apply the fungicide before the disease becomes severe.
One physical measure that can help reduce powdery mildew is pruning or removing the infected leaves and stems1 2 3. This can improve air circulation and reduce the spread of spores. However, care should be taken to avoid injuring the plant or creating wounds that can invite other pathogens. The infected plant material should be disposed of properly and not composted.
Some biological agents that can suppress powdery mildew are compost tea2, milk spray2, and buttermilk spray1. These agents can enhance the plant's immune system and inhibit the growth of the fungus. Compost tea can be made by steeping compost in water for a few days and then spraying it on the plant. Milk spray can be made by mixing one part milk with nine parts water and spraying it on the plant every 10 days2. Buttermilk spray can be made by mixing one part buttermilk with nine parts water and spraying it on the plant every 2-3 days until the powdery mildew is gone1.
Some agricultural practices that can prevent or reduce powdery mildew are planting resistant varieties2, avoiding overfertilization2, watering in the morning2, spacing the plants adequately2, and rotating crops3. These practices can improve the plant's health and vigor, reduce humidity and moisture, and break the disease cycle.
["White or gray powdery spots or patches on the leaves, stems, flowers, or fruits1 2 3 4. The spots may coalesce and cover large areas of the plant surface.", "Yellowing, browning, curling, wilting, or dropping of the infected leaves1 2 3 4. The leaves may also become distorted or deformed.", "Reduced growth, yield, quality, or flavor of the zucchini fruits1 2 3 4. The fruits may also develop sunscald or rot."]
["The presence of fungal hyphae, spores, or fruiting bodies on the plant surface4. These can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope. The fungus may appear as a white or gray powder, a network of fine threads, or small black dots."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well understood, but some studies have suggested that it may involve genetic variation, epigenetic regulation, and environmental adaptation . The type of resistance agent may depend on the specific strain of the fungus and the host plant . The level of resistance may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the stage of infection . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a microscope to examine the infected plant parts for the presence of conidia and mycelium . Alternatively, a molecular test such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to detect the fungal DNA in the plant tissue . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is complex and involves multiple factors, such as host recognition, penetration, colonization, suppression of host defense, and reproduction . The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the fungal species and strain, but some common ones include cutinases, cellulases, pectinases, proteases, and necrosis-inducing proteins . The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the degree of host specificity, susceptibility, and resistance of the plants .
