The type of crop of this plant is a cash crop, as coffee is grown for export and trade purposes1 2. The type of disease of this disease is a fungal disease, caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix2 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is a conidium, which is a type of asexual spore that is dispersed by wind2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease is airborne, as the fungal spores can travel long distances by wind and infect new plants2 5.
The period of disease onset for this disease is variable, depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the coffee variety. However, some studies have reported that the incubation period (from infection to symptom appearance) can range from 10 to 45 days4 6. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity (above 80%) and moderate temperature (between 15В°C and 28В°C), which favor the germination and infection of the spores2 4. The disease also thrives in shaded areas, which reduce the evaporation of dew from the leaves4. The soil conditions are not very relevant for the disease, as it mainly affects the leaves2.
The overwintering method of this disease is unknown, as there is no evidence of a sexual stage or an alternate host for the fungus. However, some researchers have suggested that the fungus may survive on fallen leaves or on asymptomatic plants4 6.
This involves spraying fungicides on the infected plants to prevent or reduce the spread of the fungus. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications and control effect depend on various factors such as the severity of the infection, the weather conditions, the resistance of the fungus and the environmental impact. Some examples of fungicides used for coffee rust are copper-based compounds, triazoles, strobilurins and benzimidazoles1 2.
This involves removing and destroying the infected leaves or branches to reduce the inoculum source and prevent further infection. This method is labor-intensive and may not be effective if the infection is widespread1 3.
This involves using natural enemies of the fungus, such as other fungi, bacteria or insects, to suppress its growth and reproduction. Some examples of biological agents used for coffee rust are Bacillus subtilis, Lecanicillium lecanii, Beauveria bassiana and Phytoseiulus persimilis1 4. However, biological control may have limited efficacy, specificity and consistency1.
This involves using cultural practices that enhance the plant's resistance or tolerance to the fungus, such as selecting resistant or tolerant varieties, improving soil fertility and drainage, pruning and shading the plants, intercropping with other crops and diversifying the production system1 5. These methods may reduce the susceptibility of the plants and increase their productivity and quality1.
["Yellowish or pale green spots on the upper surface of leaves, which may coalesce into larger lesions in severe cases2 3.", "Reddish-brown or orange powdery pustules on the lower surface of leaves, which contain masses of urediniospores2 3.", "Premature defoliation of leaves, which reduces photosynthesis and transpiration2 3.", "Reduced growth and development of shoots, flowers and fruits2 3.", "Lower quality and quantity of coffee beans2 3."]
["The presence of urediniospores on the lower surface of leaves, which can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope2 3.", "The presence of teliospores on older lesions, which are darker and thicker than urediniospores2 3.", "The presence of basidiospores on germinated teliospores, which are hyaline and cylindrical2 3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is variable, depending on the coffee variety and the environmental conditions. The mechanism of resistance is not fully understood, but it may involve genetic factors, biochemical factors, and structural factors1 2. The type of resistance agent is fungicide, which can be applied to the plants or to the soil3 4. The level of resistance is low to moderate, as the fungus can evolve and overcome the fungicide or the host defense3 5. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is visual inspection, which can detect the characteristic symptoms of yellow-orange spots and powdery spores on the leaves3 4. Another method is molecular detection, which can use PCR or LAMP techniques to identify the DNA of the fungus from leaf samples . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is infection through stomata, which are the pores on the leaf surface that allow gas exchange2 4. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, as there is no evidence of a sexual stage or an alternate host for the fungus2 4. However, some studies have suggested that the fungus may produce enzymes that degrade the plant cell wall or toxins that interfere with the plant metabolism . The differences in infestation of different plants are related to their genetic susceptibility, as some coffee varieties have genes that confer resistance to the fungus or trigger defense responses1 2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not applicable, as coffee rust is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium. However, some potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are genes involved in photosynthesis, as the fungus reduces the plant's ability to produce energy from light3 4, or genes involved in cell wall synthesis, as the fungus breaks down the plant's structural barrier .
