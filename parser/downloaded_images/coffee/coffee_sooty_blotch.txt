The type of crop of the coffee plant is a cash crop. A cash crop is a crop that is grown for sale rather than for personal use by the farmer or the local community1. The type of disease of the coffee leaf miner is a fungal disease. The coffee leaf miner is caused by a fungus called Leucoptera coffeella2 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of the coffee leaf miner is a conidium. A conidium is an asexual spore that is produced by some fungi and can be dispersed by wind or water. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of the coffee leaf miner are airborne and insectborne. The conidia of the fungus can be carried by air currents and infect new leaves. The adult moths of the coffee leaf miner can also spread the fungus by laying eggs on healthy leaves2.
The period of disease onset for the coffee leaf miner is variable depending on the environmental conditions and the stage of development of the larvae. The symptoms can appear from a few days to several weeks after infection. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid climates with temperatures between 18Г‚В°C and 28Г‚В°C and relative humidity above 80% . The disease also favors shaded areas and dense foliage2.
The overwintering method of this disease is unknown. I could not find any information on how the fungus or the insect survives during cold seasons.
Using fungicides or nematicides,
Pruning or uprooting infected plants,
Using natural enemies or antagonists of the pathogens,
Crop rotation, intercropping, or resistant varieties.
["Coffee miner is not a plant disease but a term used to describe a collaborative cryptocurrency mining pool that can be performed in wifi networks using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.", "However, some of the disease symptoms of coffee plants are yellowing, browning, or falling of leaves, shriveling, rotting, or mummification of berries, and wilting, dieback, or death of branches."]

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the coffee leaf miner is low. The fungus is susceptible to most fungicides and biological control agents, such as Bacillus thuringiensis1. However, some populations of the insect may develop resistance to insecticides over time2. The mechanism of resistance is unknown. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the coffee leaf miner is microscopic examination. The fungus can be detected by observing the conidia and the mycelium on the infected leaves under a microscope3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the coffee leaf miner is leaf mining. The female moth lays eggs on the lower surface of the leaves, and the larvae hatch and penetrate into the leaf tissue. The larvae feed on the mesophyll cells and create tunnels or mines inside the leaves. The mines reduce the photosynthetic capacity of the plant and cause necrosis and defoliation4. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the coffee leaf miner are unknown. I could not find any information on the bacterial pathogens associated with this disease.
