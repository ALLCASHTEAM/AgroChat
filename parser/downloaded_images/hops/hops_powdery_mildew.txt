The type of crop of this plant is a cash crop1, as hops are mainly grown for brewing beer and other beverages. The type of disease of this disease is a fungal disease2 3, caused by the ascomycete fungus Podosphaera macularis2 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is a conidium, which is a type of asexual spore2 3. The fungus can also produce cleistothecia, which are sexual structures that contain ascospores2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are airborne, as the conidia are dispersed by wind and rain4 5. The cleistothecia can also survive in plant debris or soil and germinate in the spring to release ascospores2 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease is spring, when new shoots emerge from infected buds or crowns2 5. The disease can continue to develop throughout the season if environmental conditions are favorable2 5. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and dry, as the fungus thrives in temperatures between 68В°F and 86В°F and low moisture levels2 5. However, high humidity can favor sporulation and infection2 5.
The overwintering method of this disease is infected buds or crowns, which serve as sources of inoculum for the next season2 3. The fungus may also overwinter as cleistothecia in plant debris or soil2 3.
Fungicides such as quinoxyfen, trifloxystrobin, metrafenone, proquinazid, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, triflumizole, myclobutanil, tebuconazole, fenbuconazole, propiconazole, difenoconazole and cyproconazole. Application dose and period depend on the product label and the disease severity. Number of applications should be minimized to avoid resistance development. Control effect varies depending on the product and timing of application. 1
Cutting off infected shoots or cones and removing them from the field. This can reduce inoculum sources and disease spread.1
No effective biological control agents have been reported for hops powdery mildew.1
Using resistant or tolerant cultivars such as Cascade, Centennial, Chinook, Fuggle, Galena, Glacier, Mt. Hood, Nugget, Perle, Tettnang and Willamette. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization and irrigation that can promote lush growth and high humidity. Pruning lower leaves to improve air circulation and reduce humidity. Removing basal spikes in spring to eliminate overwintering inoculum.1

The phytopathogenic fungus of hops powdery mildew is Podosphaera macularis, an ascomycete that belongs to the Erysiphales order1. This fungus can develop resistance to fungicides with different modes of action, such as demethylation inhibitors (DMIs), quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs)2. The mechanism of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide group and the fungal population. For example, resistance to DMIs may be conferred by mutations in the CYP51 gene that encodes the target enzyme of these fungicides2. Resistance to QoIs may be due to mutations in the cytochrome b gene that encodes the target enzyme of these fungicides2. Resistance to SDHIs may be associated with mutations in the SDH genes that encode the target enzyme complex of these fungicides2. The level of resistance may also vary depending on the fungicide group and the fungal population. For example, resistance to DMIs may be quantitative or qualitative, depending on the number and type of mutations in the CYP51 gene2. Resistance to QoIs may be qualitative, meaning that a single mutation in the cytochrome b gene can confer high levels of resistance2. Resistance to SDHIs may be quantitative or qualitative, depending on the number and type of mutations in the SDH genes2. The type of resistance agent may refer to the chemical class or group of fungicides that share a common mode of action and target site. For example, some common resistance agents for hops powdery mildew are DMIs (e.g., tebuconazole, difenoconazole, propiconazole), QoIs (e.g., azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin), and SDHIs (e.g., boscalid, fluxapyroxad)3 2. 
One possible quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of hops powdery mildew is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology4. PCR is a technique that can amplify specific DNA sequences from a sample using primers, enzymes, and thermal cycles4. A PCR-based test method for hops powdery mildew can use primers that are specific for P. macularis and can detect its presence or absence in plant tissues4. The test can also use primers that are specific for certain mutations that confer resistance to fungicides and can determine their frequency in fungal populations4. A PCR-based test method for hops powdery mildew can be performed using a portable device that can extract DNA from plant samples, amplify it using PCR, and analyze it using gel electrophoresis or real-time fluorescence detection4. The test can provide results within a few hours and can help growers make informed decisions about disease management4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of hops powdery mildew involves several steps: spore germination, appressorium formation, penetration, haustorium formation, hyphal growth, sporulation, and dissemination1. Spore germination: The fungus produces two types of spores: conidia (asexual spores) and ascospores (sexual spores)1. Conidia are produced on branched structures called conidiophores that emerge from infected plant tissues1. Ascospores are produced inside sac-like structures called asci that are formed within fruiting bodies called cleistothecia1. Both types of spores can be dispersed by wind or rain and land on susceptible plant tissues1. Spore germination occurs when there is sufficient humidity and temperature1. Appressorium formation: After germination, the spore produces a germ tube that grows along the plant surface until it reaches a suitable site for infection1. The germ tube then forms a specialized structure called an appressorium that adheres to the plant cuticle and generates high pressure to penetrate it1. Penetration: The appressorium produces a thin projection called a penetration peg that breaches the plant cuticle and enters the epidermal cell1. The penetration peg then enlarges into a feeding structure called a haustorium1. Haustorium formation: The haustorium is an intracellular structure that remains separated from the plant cytoplasm by an extra-haustorial membrane1. The haustorium absorbs nutrients and water from the plant cell and delivers them to the fungal hyphae1. The haustorium also secretes effector molecules that modulate plant defense responses and facilitate fungal colonization1. Hyphal growth: The fungal hyphae grow intercellularly along the plant tissues, forming a network called mycelium1. The hyphae produce new appressoria and haustoria at regular intervals to infect more plant cells1. The hyphae also produce enzymes that degrade plant cell walls and facilitate fungal expansion1. Sporulation: The fungal hyphae produce conidiophores that emerge through stomata or cuticle openings and bear conidia at their tips1. The conidia detach from the conidiophores and are dispersed by wind or rain to initiate new cycles of infection1. Under favorable conditions, the fungus can also produce cleistothecia that contain asci with ascospores inside1. The cleistothecia overwinter on infected plant debris or soil and release ascospores in spring when environmental conditions are suitable1. Dissemination: The fungus can disseminate by spore dispersal or by systemic infection. Spore dispersal occurs when conidia or ascospores are carried by wind or rain to new host plants or new locations1. Systemic infection occurs when infected hop crowns or roots produce infected shoots (spikes) in spring that can spread the disease within or between hop yards1. 
Hops powdery mildew is not caused by bacteria but by fungi. Therefore, there are no phytopathogenic bacteria involved in this disease. However, if you meant potential targets of fungicides against hops powdery mildew, then some possible targets are: Ergosterol biosynthesis: Ergosterol is an essential component of fungal cell membranes that regulates fluidity and permeability2. Fungicides that inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis, such as DMIs, interfere with fungal growth and viability by disrupting membrane structure and function2. Mitochondrial respiration: Mitochondria are organelles that produce energy for fungal cells through oxidative phosphorylation2. Fungicides that inhibit mitochondrial respiration, such as QoIs and SDHIs, block electron transport and ATP synthesis in fungal cells, leading to energy depletion and cell death2. Signal transduction: Signal transduction is a process that allows fungal cells to perceive and respond to environmental stimuli through cascades of molecular interactions2. Fungicides that inhibit signal transduction, such as phenylpyrroles (e.g., fludioxonil), affect fungal development and differentiation by altering gene expression and protein activity2.
