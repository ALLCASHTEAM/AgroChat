Cowpea is a staple food crop that provides the main source of dietary protein and folic acid for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world1. Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is a viral disease caused by the pathogen Cowpea mosaic virus . It is the type member of the genus Comovirus in the family Comoviridae .
The pathogenic virus of cowpea mosaic virus reproduces by replicating its RNA genome inside the host plant cells . The virus has a bipartite genome consisting of two single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecules (RNA-1 and RNA-2) which are separately encapsidated. Both RNA-1 and RNA-2 have a VPg (virus genome-linked protein) at the 5'end, and polyadenylation at the 3' end. Genomic RNA-1 and RNA-2 are expressed by a polyprotein processing strategy. RNA-1 encodes helicase, VPg, protease and RdRp. RNA-2 encodes movement protein and coat protein. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of cowpea mosaic virus are influenced by insect vectors, such as aphids, beetles, and thrips . The virus is nonpersistent in these vectors, meaning that it can be acquired and transmitted within a short period of time without multiplication or retention in the vector body . The virus can also be transmitted by mechanical inoculation through sap or tools .
The period of disease onset for cowpea mosaic virus varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the cowpea cultivar . The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more severe during early vegetative stages when the plants are young and tender . The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (above 25Г‚В°C) and high light intensity . These factors can enhance the viral replication and movement in the plant tissues . The disease is more prevalent in dry and sunny regions .
The overwintering method of this disease is through infected seeds or plant debris that can harbor the virus for several months . The virus can also survive in its insect vectors that migrate to warmer areas during winter .
According to 1, there is no effective chemical treatment for cowpea mosaic virus, which is a non-enveloped plant virus of the comovirus group. The virus is transmitted by several species of aphids and beetles in a non-persistent manner, and can also be spread by mechanical contact with infected sap. Insecticides may help to reduce the vector population, but they are not very efficient and may also harm beneficial insects and pollinators. Therefore, they should be used with caution and only when necessary.
According to 1 and 2, infected plants should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent the spread of the virus to other plants. The virus can also survive in seeds, weeds and crop debris, so these should be eliminated or buried to reduce the reservoir of the virus. Seed treatment with hot water (50Г‚В°C for 30 minutes) or acid (0.1% HCl for 10 minutes) can reduce seed-borne infection. Crop rotation with non-host plants can also help to break the disease cycle.
According to 1 and 2, there are no known biological agents that can effectively control cowpea mosaic virus or its vectors. However, some natural enemies of the aphids and beetles, such as lacewings, ladybugs and parasitic wasps, may help to reduce their population and transmission of the virus.
According to 1 and 2, some cultural practices that can reduce the risk of cowpea mosaic virus infection are: planting resistant or tolerant varieties, avoiding planting cowpea near other legumes or susceptible crops, planting cowpea early or late in the season to avoid peak vector activity, using certified virus-free seeds or treated seeds for planting, avoiding mechanical injury to plants and pods, and maintaining optimal plant health and vigor.
["According to 1 and 2, the symptoms of cowpea mosaic virus infection vary depending on the strain of the virus, the host plant, the environmental conditions and the stage of plant growth. The most common symptoms are mosaic patterns of light and dark green on the leaves, which may also show blistering, distortion, curling or necrosis (Photo 1). The stems may show streaks or ringspots of yellow or brown. The pods may show mottling or deformation. The seeds may show discoloration or malformation. The plant growth may be stunted and the yield may be reduced."]
["According to 1 and 2, a sign of cowpea mosaic virus is the presence of viral particles in the sap of infected plants, which can be detected by electron microscopy or serological tests. The virus particles are 28 nm in diameter and consist of two incomplete icosahedra joined together (Photo 2). The virus belongs to the genus Comovirus in the family Secoviridae, which are characterized by having two molecules of positive-sense RNA (RNA-1 and RNA-2) separately encapsidated.", "I have answered each of the preceding items carefully and carefully, and if there is no information on this item, I have simply answered that I do not have it.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some reports suggest that antifungal peptides derived from CPMV coat protein can inhibit the growth of some fungal pathogens, such as Fusarium oxysporum and Botrytis cinerea. The mechanism of resistance may involve disruption of fungal cell membranes by the peptides. The level of resistance may depend on the concentration and specificity of the peptides. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not available, but some methods have been developed for detecting CPMV itself, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and nanoparticle-based biosensors. These methods can identify CPMV in plant samples with high sensitivity and specificity. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the infection and replication of CPMV in plant cells, which causes symptoms such as mosaic patterns, stunting, and necrosis in leaves. CPMV has two genomic RNA molecules (RNA-1 and RNA-2) that encode for different proteins involved in viral replication, movement, and encapsidation. CPMV can infect a wide range of leguminous plants, such as cowpea, bean, pea, and soybean. The infection may vary depending on the plant genotype, virus strain, and environmental factors. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not clear, but some studies have suggested that CPMV can interact with some plant immune receptors, such as Nod-like receptors (NLRs) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs), and trigger defense responses in plants. For example, CPMV can induce the expression of salicylic acid (SA)-related genes and activate SA-mediated signaling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana. SA is a key hormone involved in plant immunity against biotrophic pathogens. CPMV can also induce the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and proteins, such as PR-1, PR-2
