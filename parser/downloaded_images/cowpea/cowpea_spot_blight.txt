Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is a legume crop that can be used as a food, forage, cover crop or green manure1. It can be considered as a staple food crop in some regions of the world, especially Africa and Asia, where it is an important source of protein1 2. Cowpea can be affected by several diseases caused by different types of pathogens, such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, oomycetes or nematodes2. One of the most common and serious fungal diseases of cowpea is Cercospora leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cercospora canescens3. Another fungal disease of cowpea is web blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani4. Some examples of bacterial diseases of cowpea are bacterial blight and bacterial pustule, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vignicola and Xanthomonas campestris pv. vignaeuguiculatae, respectively2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of Cercospora leaf spot is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain3. The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of web blight is by producing sclerotia, which are hard masses of fungal tissue that can survive in the soil or plant debris4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of Cercospora leaf spot are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and wind5. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions, and the spores can be spread by wind or rain splash3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of web blight are also influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, moisture and plant density4. The disease is more severe in warm and wet conditions, and the sclerotia can be spread by soil movement or contaminated seeds4.
The period of disease onset for Cercospora leaf spot is usually after flowering, when the plants are mature and have a dense canopy3. The period of disease onset for web blight is usually at seedling or vegetative stage, when the plants are young and have a high moisture content4. The environmental conditions required for Cercospora leaf spot are temperatures between 20Г‚В°C and 30Г‚В°C, relative humidity above 80%, and frequent rainfall or irrigation3. The environmental conditions required for web blight are temperatures between 25Г‚В°C and 35Г‚В°C, relative humidity above 90%, and prolonged periods of leaf wetness4.
The overwintering method of Cercospora leaf spot is by surviving on infected plant debris or seeds3. The overwintering method of web blight is by surviving as sclerotia in the soil or plant debris4.
Spraying cowpea foliage with streptomycin sulfate of 0.2% concentration1 or copper and copper+maneb mixtures2 can reduce the incidence and severity of bacterial blight and increase the yield of cowpea.
Cutting off the infected parts of the plant can prevent the spread of the disease to healthy tissues.
Biological control: No information found.
Agricultural control: Planting disease-free seed, using a crop rotation of 2 or more years between bean crops, eliminating alternate hosts such as volunteer beans and weeds, planting tolerant or resistant cultivars, and avoiding overhead irrigation can help prevent or reduce the disease3 1 4.
["On leaves: Water-soaked, often angular shaped spots on leaves that gradually grow to form large-brown spots of dead tissue, often surrounded by a very narrow zone of yellow tissue. Spots can form at the margins and interveinal regions. In severe infections, the plant appears burnt and dead. Leaves remain attached3.", "On pods: Spots are generally circular, slightly sunken, water-soaked and dark green in color. As spots age they turn dark red-brown in color and under extremely humid conditions are covered with bacterial ooze3.", "On stems: Water-soaked spots turn red-brown in color, generally without a yellow margin. Stems may be girdled, leading to wilting. Stem spots are uncommon3.", "On seed: Yellow or brown-colored spots on seed. Seed may be shrivelled and show poor germination3."]
["The physical evidence of the pathogen itself on the plant is the bacterial ooze that covers the pod spots under humid conditions3.", "The bacterium can also be detected by using molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of Cercospora leaf spot is not well studied, but some reports suggest that the fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as benzimidazoles and strobilurins. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the target genes or enzymes of the fungicides, such as tubulin or cytochrome b. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide dose and the fungal strain. I do not have information on the resistance agent of the fungus. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of Cercospora leaf spot is by using a lactophenol cotton blue stain. This method involves placing a small piece of infected leaf tissue in a drop of lactophenol cotton blue solution on a glass slide and examining it under a microscope. The fungus can be identified by its characteristic hyphae and conidia. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of Cercospora leaf spot is by producing toxins that cause necrosis and chlorosis of the plant cells. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are not well known, but some studies have identified some candidate genes that may be involved in toxin biosynthesis, such as polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host specificity and susceptibility of the fungus, as well as the plant defense mechanisms. 
I do not have information on the potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of Cercospora leaf spot, because this disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium.
