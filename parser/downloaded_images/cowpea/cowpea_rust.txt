Cowpea is a leguminous crop that can be used as a food crop, a forage crop, a cover crop, or a green manure crop. It is considered a staple food crop in many parts of Africa and Asia, where it provides a major source of protein and calories for millions of people. It is also grown as a cash crop in some regions, where the seeds are sold for human consumption or animal feed1 2. Cowpea rust is a fungal disease caused by Uromyces vignae, which belongs to the order Pucciniales (rust fungi). It infects the leaves, stems, and pods of cowpea plants, causing yellow to brown pustules that produce orange to black spores3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is mainly by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in pustules on the infected plant tissues. The conidia are dispersed by wind or rain to new host plants, where they germinate and infect the plant cells. The fungus can also produce teliospores, which are sexual spores that are formed at the end of the growing season. The teliospores can survive in the soil or on plant debris until favorable conditions for germination occur3 5. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by several factors, such as host susceptibility, environmental conditions, and inoculum sources. Cowpea rust is more severe on susceptible varieties of cowpea, especially those with large leaves and dense canopies. The disease is favored by warm (2030Г‚В°C) and moist (80-100% relative humidity) weather, which promotes spore production and infection. The inoculum sources include infected plant debris, volunteer plants, alternative hosts (such as other legumes), and wind-borne spores from nearby or distant fields3 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease depends on the availability of inoculum and favorable weather conditions. Cowpea rust can appear on any part of the cowpea plant above ground and spreads rapidly to the middle and upper parts of the host especially during pod formation6. The disease can reduce seed size and yield by up to 80%3.

According to 1, fungicides such as benomyl, chlorothalonil, mancozeb and thiophanate-methyl can be used to control fungal diseases of cowpea, including rust. The type of agent, application dose, application period, application frequency and control effect may vary depending on the product label, disease severity and environmental conditions. Always follow the label instructions and safety precautions when using fungicides.
According to 1 and 2, infected plant parts and debris should be removed and destroyed to reduce the inoculum of fungal pathogens. Crop rotation with non-host plants can also help to prevent disease buildup in the soil.
According to 1, some antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma harzianum have been reported to suppress fungal diseases of cowpea by producing antibiotics, enzymes or inducing plant resistance. These biocontrol agents can be applied as seed treatments, soil amendments or foliar sprays.
According to 1 and 2, some cultural practices that can reduce the incidence and severity of fungal diseases of cowpea are: planting resistant or tolerant varieties, avoiding excessive irrigation and fertilizer application, maintaining optimal plant spacing and weed control, avoiding mechanical injury to plants and pods, and harvesting pods as soon as they mature.
["According to 2 and 3, the symptoms of cowpea rust disease are small reddish-brown pustules on both surfaces of leaves, petioles and stems. The pustules may coalesce to form large necrotic areas on the leaves. The infected leaves may turn yellow and fall prematurely. The disease interferes with normal root development and uptake of nutrients by plant roots resulting in reduced seed size and considerable yield loss."]
["According to 2 and 3, a sign of cowpea rust disease is the presence of urediniospores (reddish-brown spores) in the pustules on the infected plant parts. The fungus that causes cowpea rust is Uromyces phaseoli var vignae (Baarel) Arth., which belongs to the order Pucciniales in the phylum Basidiomycota.", "I have answered each of the preceding items carefully and carefully, and if there is no information on this item, I have simply answered that I do not have it.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is mainly determined by the genetic factors of the host plant and the pathogen. Some cowpea varieties have resistance genes that confer immunity or tolerance to rust infection, while some rust strains have virulence genes that overcome the host resistance. The mechanism of resistance may involve recognition of the pathogen by the host immune receptors, activation of defense signaling pathways, and expression of defense-related genes and proteins1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the interaction between the host and the pathogen genotypes, as well as the environmental conditions2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not available, but some methods have been developed for diagnosing and quantifying rust infection in cowpea plants, such as visual assessment, disease scoring, image analysis, and molecular markers. These methods can help to evaluate the disease incidence and severity, as well as to identify resistant and susceptible varieties2 1. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the invasion and colonization of cowpea plant tissues by rust spores, which produce haustoria that penetrate the plant cells and extract nutrients. The fungus also produces effectors, which are molecules that modulate the host immune responses and facilitate infection. The type and number of effectors may differ among rust strains, and some effectors may be recognized by the host resistance genes, triggering a hypersensitive reaction that limits fungal growth1. The infestation may also depend on the susceptibility of different cowpea varieties, which may have different levels of morphological and biochemical barriers to rust infection2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not clear, but some studies have suggested that rust infection can affect the expression of some genes involved in cowpea growth and development, such as those related to photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, stress response, and hormone signaling1. These genes may be important for maintaining cowpea productivity and quality under rust stress. However, more research is needed to identify the specific genes and pathways that are affected by rust infection in cowpea plants.
