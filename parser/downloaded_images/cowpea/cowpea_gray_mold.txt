Cowpea is a climbing annual in the family <em>Fabaceae</em> grown for its edible seeds and pods. It is an important grain legume in Africa, parts of the America and in Asia. It can be consumed fresh along with the pods and leaves as a vegetable, or dried after cooking. It can also be used as a forage or for hay or silage1. Cowpea gray mold is a fungal disease caused by <em>Botrytis cinerea</em>, a necrotrophic fungus that affects many plant species2. It is also known as gray mold or Botrytis bunch rot2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of cowpea gray mold is by conidia, which are asexual spores produced on specialized structures called conidiophores2. The conidia are usually grayish in color and form clusters that resemble grapes2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of cowpea gray mold are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind2. The disease is favored by cool and moist conditions, especially during flowering and pod formation stages2. The conidia are airborne and can be dispersed by wind or rain splash to infect new hosts2. The fungus can also infect through wounds or natural openings on the plant tissues2.
The period of disease onset for cowpea gray mold depends on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the host plant2. The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more severe during flowering and pod formation stages2. The symptoms usually appear within 3 to 7 days after infection2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool and moist conditions, with temperatures ranging from 15 to 25Г‚В°C (59 to 77Г‚В°F) and relative humidity above 85%2. The disease is also favored by poor ventilation, high plant density, excessive nitrogen fertilization, and irrigation practices that wet the foliage2.
The overwintering method of cowpea gray mold is by sclerotia, which are hardened masses of fungal hyphae that can survive in soil or plant debris for several years2. The sclerotia can germinate under favorable conditions and produce conidia or sexual spores called ascospores that can initiate new infections2.
Fungicides such as benomyl, carbendazim, chlorothalonil, iprodione, mancozeb, and thiophanate-methyl can be applied to reduce the disease incidence and severity. The application dose, period, frequency, and effect may vary depending on the product label, environmental conditions, and disease pressure. 1
Removing and destroying the infected plant parts can help prevent the spread of the fungus. 2
Some antagonistic microorganisms such as <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em> have been reported to inhibit the growth of <em>Botrytis cinerea </em>in vitro and in vivo. 3
Practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, weed management, irrigation management, and avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization can reduce the susceptibility of cowpea to gray mold. 2

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is mainly based on detoxification of fungicides by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and ABC transporters1. The type of resistance agent depends on the mode of action of the fungicide, such as benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, phenylpyrroles, anilinopyrimidines, or quinone outside inhibitors1. The level of resistance varies depending on the fungal strain, the fungicide dose, and the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is by using molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the presence of specific DNA sequences of <em>Botrytis cinerea</em> in plant samples1 2. These methods are rapid, sensitive, and specific, but they require specialized equipment and trained personnel1 2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is by secreting a variety of enzymes and toxins that degrade the plant cell wall and cause necrosis1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are influenced by the fungal genotype, the host genotype, and the environmental conditions1. Some examples of effectors are cutinases, polygalacturonases, pectin methylesterases, cellulases, xylanases, proteases, lipases, and botrydial toxin1. The differences in infestation of different plants are related to the degree of susceptibility or resistance of the host plant, which can be determined by genetic factors or induced defenses1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well known, but some studies have suggested that knocking out some genes involved in signal transduction, cell wall biosynthesis, or secondary metabolism can reduce the virulence or fitness of Botrytis cinerea1. For example, mutants lacking genes encoding G protein subunits, mitogen-activated protein kinases, calcineurin, chitin synthase, or polyketide synthase showed reduced pathogenicity or growth on various hosts1.
