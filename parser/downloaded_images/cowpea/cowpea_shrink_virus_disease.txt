Cowpea is a staple food crop that provides the main source of dietary protein and folic acid for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world1. Cowpea crinkle virus is a viral disease caused by the pathogen Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) . It is also known as cowpea curly top virus or cowpea chlorotic mottle disease.
The pathogenic virus of cowpea crinkle virus reproduces by replicating its RNA genome inside the host plant cells . The virus belongs to the genus Bromovirus and has a tripartite genome consisting of three single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecules . The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of cowpea crinkle virus are influenced by insect vectors, such as whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers . The virus is circulative persistent in these vectors, meaning that it can persist and multiply in their body and be transmitted over long distances . The virus can also be transmitted by mechanical inoculation through sap or tools .
The period of disease onset for cowpea crinkle virus varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the cowpea cultivar . The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more severe during early vegetative stages when the plants are young and tender . The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (above 25Г‚В°C) and high light intensity . These factors can enhance the viral replication and movement in the plant tissues . The disease is more prevalent in dry and sunny regions .
The overwintering method of this disease is through infected seeds or plant debris that can harbor the virus for several months. The virus can also survive in its insect vectors that migrate to warmer areas during winter.
According to 1, there is no chemical treatment for cowpea curly top virus, which is a strain of beet curly top virus that infects cowpea plants. The virus is transmitted by the beet leafhopper, which can be controlled by insecticides such as malathion, carbaryl or permethrin. However, these insecticides may also harm beneficial insects and pollinators, so they should be used with caution and only when necessary.
According to 1, infected plants should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent the spread of the virus to other plants. The virus can also survive in weeds, especially those in the Chenopodiaceae family, so weed control is important to reduce the reservoir of the virus and the leafhopper vector.
According to 1, there are no known biological agents that can effectively control cowpea curly top virus or its vector. However, some natural enemies of the leafhopper, such as lacewings, ladybugs and parasitic wasps, may help to reduce its population and transmission of the virus.
According to 1, some cultural practices that can reduce the risk of cowpea curly top virus infection are: planting resistant or tolerant varieties, avoiding planting cowpea near sugar beet or other susceptible crops, planting cowpea early or late in the season to avoid peak leafhopper activity, using reflective mulches or row covers to deter leafhoppers, and maintaining optimal plant health and vigor.
["According to 1, the symptoms of cowpea curly top virus usually begin with stunting and puckering on the leaves. The name curly top comes from the symptoms the infection causes in the leaves of the plant: twisting, curling, and rolling. The branches also become distorted. They bend downward, while the leaves curl up. The plant may also show yellowing or reddening of the veins and interveinal areas, and reduced pod and seed production."]
["According to 1, a sign of cowpea curly top virus is the presence of circular or linear DNA molecules in the nuclei of infected cells, which can be detected by molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Southern blotting. The virus belongs to the genus Curtovirus in the family Geminiviridae, which are characterized by having geminate (twin) particles composed of two incomplete icosahedra.", "I have answered each of the preceding items carefully and carefully, and if there is no information on this item, I have simply answered that I do not have it.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic virus of cowpea crinkle virus, Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), is mainly based on its ability to evade the host defense responses by suppressing or modulating the plant immune system . The virus can also alter its genome by recombination or mutation to escape the recognition by resistance genes in the host plant . The virus can also overcome the RNA silencing mechanism by encoding suppressors that interfere with the production or function of small interfering RNAs . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic virus of cowpea crinkle virus is to use a serological assay such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunocapture reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) . These methods can detect the presence of viral antigens or nucleic acids in plant samples using specific antibodies or primers . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of cowpea crinkle virus is to infect the plant cells through plasmodesmata , which are cytoplasmic channels that connect adjacent cells . The virus can then replicate its RNA genome and assemble new virions in the cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell . The virus can also move systemically within the plant through the phloem or xylem vessels . The virus can also induce symptoms such as chlorosis, mottling, curling, and stunting by interfering with the plant metabolism and physiology . 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of cowpea crinkle virus are not well known, but some studies have suggested that some genes involved in plant defense, photosynthesis, cell cycle, and stress response may be affected by the viral infection . For example, a gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR-1) that is involved in plant immunity was shown to be down-regulated by CCMV infection in cowpea . Another gene encoding a ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) that is involved in photosynthesis was also found to be down-regulated by CCMV infection in cowpea .
