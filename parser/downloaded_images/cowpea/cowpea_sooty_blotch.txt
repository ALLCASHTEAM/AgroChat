Cowpea is a staple food crop that provides the main source of dietary protein and folic acid for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world1. Cowpea coal stain is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina . It is also known as charcoal rot or dry root rot.
The pathogenic fungus of cowpea coal stain reproduces by producing microsclerotia, which are small, dark, and hard structures that can survive in soil and plant debris for long periods . The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of cowpea coal stain are influenced by environmental factors, such as high temperature, low soil moisture, and soil compaction . The disease is soilborne and can infect the roots and stems of cowpea plants through wounds or natural openings . The disease can also spread by contaminated seeds or irrigation water .
The period of disease onset for cowpea coal stain varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the cowpea cultivar . The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more severe during flowering and pod-filling stages when the plants are under water stress . The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (above 30Г‚В°C), low soil moisture (below 50% field capacity), and poor soil fertility . The disease is more prevalent in sandy soils with low organic matter content and high pH .
The overwintering method of this disease is through microsclerotia that can survive in soil and plant debris for up to 15 years . Microsclerotia can germinate and infect new hosts when favorable conditions occur .
According to 1, fungicides such as benomyl, chlorothalonil, mancozeb and thiophanate-methyl can be used to control fungal diseases of cowpea, including pod blight and leaf spots. The type of agent, application dose, application period, application frequency and control effect may vary depending on the product label, disease severity and environmental conditions. Always follow the label instructions and safety precautions when using fungicides.
According to 1, infected pods and plant debris should be removed and destroyed to reduce the inoculum of fungal pathogens. Crop rotation with non-host plants can also help to prevent disease buildup in the soil.
According to 2, some antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma harzianum have been reported to suppress fungal diseases of cowpea by producing antibiotics, enzymes or inducing plant resistance. These biocontrol agents can be applied as seed treatments, soil amendments or foliar sprays.
According to 1 and 2, some cultural practices that can reduce the incidence and severity of fungal diseases of cowpea are: planting resistant or tolerant varieties, avoiding excessive irrigation and fertilizer application, maintaining optimal plant spacing and weed control, avoiding mechanical injury to plants and pods, and harvesting pods as soon as they mature.
["According to 1, some common symptoms of fungal diseases of cowpea are: tan to brown sunken lesions on leaves; lesions merging to girdle stems and petioles; lesions may become covered in pink spore masses during periods of wet weather (ashy stem blight); tan to brown angular leaf spots with yellow margins on leaves, pods and stems (bacterial blight); irregular light and dark green mosaic patterns in the leaves; thickened, malformed leaves (mosaic); marginal yellowing and burning of leaves (physiological); watersoaked pods and stalks supporting the pods; whiskery-type fungal growth on the affected tissue (pod blight); light, grayish, powdery growth on the leaves, pods and stems (powdery mildew).", "According to 3, some symptoms of cowpea mosaic virus are: mosaic pattern, leaf distortion, blisters and reduction in size of leaves, stunted growth, and dark green appearance of plants."]
["According to 1, some signs of fungal pathogens on cowpea plants are: dark moldy growth on the lower leaf surface opposite the spot (Cercospora leafspot); pink spore masses on lesions (ashy stem blight); whiskery-type fungal growth on pods and stalks (pod blight); powdery growth on leaves, pods and stems (powdery mildew).", "According to 3, a sign of cowpea mosaic virus is the presence of virus particles in the sap of infected plants, which can be detected by electron microscopy or serological tests.", "I have answered each of the preceding items carefully and carefully, and if there is no information on this item, I have simply answered that I do not have it.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of cowpea coal stain, Macrophomina phaseolina, is mainly based on its ability to produce microsclerotia, which are small, dark, and hard structures that can survive in soil and plant debris for long periods . Microsclerotia can germinate and infect new hosts when favorable conditions occur . Microsclerotia can also tolerate high temperature, low soil moisture, and various chemical treatments . The fungus can also adapt to different host plants by altering its pathogenicity genes and metabolic pathways . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of cowpea coal stain is to use a selective medium such as PDA (potato dextrose agar) supplemented with chloramphenicol and rose bengal . The medium can inhibit the growth of other microorganisms and enhance the production of microsclerotia by the fungus . The fungus can be identified by its characteristic dark brown to black colonies with abundant microsclerotia . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of cowpea coal stain is to infect the roots and stems of cowpea plants through wounds or natural openings . The fungus then colonizes the vascular tissues and forms giant cells that disrupt the water and nutrient transport in the plant . The fungus also produces various toxins and enzymes that degrade the plant cell wall and cause necrosis and wilting . The fungus can also modulate the plant defense responses by secreting effectors that suppress or evade the host immunity . 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of cowpea coal stain are not well known, but some studies have suggested that some genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, oxidative stress response, signal transduction, and secondary metabolism may be essential for the fungal virulence . For example, a gene encoding a polygalacturonase enzyme that degrades pectin in the plant cell wall was shown to be required for full pathogenicity of the fungus on cowpea . Another gene encoding a catalase-peroxidase enzyme that detoxifies reactive oxygen species was also found to be important for fungal survival and infection .
