Vegetable beans are a type of horticultural crop1, which are grown for their edible pods or seeds. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease1 2, caused by the fungal organism Erysiphe polygoni1 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing conidia1 4, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or insects. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by warm weather, high humidity, and dense plantings1 5. The fungus grows as a white powdery coating over the surfaces of leaves, stems, and pods2 4. The spores are carried by air currents or insects to new host plants4.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the host plants. Powdery mildew can infect plants at any stage of growth, but it is more common and severe on older plants1 2. The first symptoms usually appear as small white spots on the upper surface of leaves2 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm temperatures (between 20В°C and 30В°C) and high relative humidity (above 80%)1 2. The fungus does not need free water on the plant surface to germinate and infect2 4. The disease is also favored by low light intensity, poor air circulation, and excessive nitrogen fertilization1 2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by producing cleistothecia4, which are round dark-colored structures that contain sexual spores. These structures can survive on fallen leaves or in buds and can germinate in favorable conditions4.
Fungicides such as sulfur, copper, chlorothalonil, myclobutanil, and tebuconazole can be applied to prevent or reduce the severity of powdery mildew1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease situation. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the fungus1.
Cutting off and removing the infected parts of the plant can reduce the inoculum and prevent further spread of the disease2 3. However, this may not be feasible or effective when the disease is widespread or severe2.
Some biological agents such as Bacillus subtilis, Ampelomyces quisqualis, and Trichoderma harzianum have been reported to have some antagonistic activity against powdery mildew1 . However, their efficacy and availability may be limited by environmental factors and regulatory issues1 .
Cultural practices such as avoiding overhead irrigation, watering early in the day, providing adequate spacing and support for climbing beans, improving air circulation, reducing nitrogen fertilization, planting in full sun, and selecting resistant varieties or cultivars can help prevent or minimize powdery mildew infection1 2 3.

Mechanism of resistance: The fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides by altering its target site, detoxifying the fungicide, or reducing its uptake1 2. The resistance can be qualitative (single gene) or quantitative (polygenic) and can be influenced by the fungicide mode of action, dose, frequency, and timing1 2. Type of resistance agent: The fungicides that have been reported to have resistance issues with powdery mildew include triazoles, strobilurins, benzimidazoles, and dicarboximides1 2. Some examples are tebuconazole, azoxystrobin, thiophanate-methyl, and iprodione1 2. Level of resistance: The level of resistance can vary depending on the fungicide group, the fungal population, and the environmental conditions1 2. Some studies have reported moderate to high levels of resistance to triazoles and strobilurins in powdery mildew populations from different crops1 2. 
Microscopic examination: A simple and rapid method to identify the powdery mildew fungus is to examine the infected plant material under a microscope or a hand lens3. The characteristic features of the fungus are the white powdery mycelium, the conidia (spores) that are produced in chains, and the cleistothecia (sexual structures) that are round and dark-colored with appendages3. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: Pathogenic effectors are molecules that are secreted by the fungus to manipulate the host plant's defense and metabolism4. Some examples of powdery mildew effectors are Ecp6, Avra10, Avrk1, and CSEP00644. The number of effectors in powdery mildew genomes can range from hundreds to thousands depending on the species4. Differences in infestation of different plants: Powdery mildew fungi are usually host-specific, meaning they can only infect certain plant species or genera4. This is because they have co-evolved with their hosts and adapted to their specific defense mechanisms4. However, some powdery mildew species can infect a wide range of hosts by using different effectors or overcoming host resistance genes4. 
Knockout lethal genes: Knockout lethal genes are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of the fungus and can be used as potential targets for fungicide development or genetic engineering. Some examples of knockout lethal genes in powdery mildew are PMR1 (calcium transporter), PMR5 (cell wall biosynthesis), PMR6 (glycosyl hydrolase), and PMK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase).
