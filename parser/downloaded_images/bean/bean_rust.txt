The type of crop of this plant is a legume crop that can be used as a cash crop, a horticultural crop or a staple crop, depending on the variety and the market1 2. The type of disease is a fungal disease caused by Uromyces appendiculatus, which has at least 35 pathotypes and is extremely variable1 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of the disease is by spores. There are two types of spores: urediniospores and teliospores. Urediniospores are red-brown, powdery spores that form on leaves and pods and spread the disease during the growing season. Teliospores are black to brown spores that form within the urediniospores and enable the fungus to survive between crop cycles and initiate new infections1 3 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of the disease are influenced by environmental factors, host resistance and pathogen variability. The disease is mainly airborne, as the urediniospores are carried by wind to new plants. The spores can also be dispersed by water splash, insects or contaminated tools. The spores can infect all aboveground parts of the plant, but mostly the leaves and pods5 3 4.
The period of time during which the disease occurs depends on the availability of inoculum, susceptible hosts and favorable weather conditions. The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more severe when it infects young plants or plants at flowering stage. The disease can develop rapidly under warm (18-28Г‚В°C) and moist conditions, with long periods of leaf wetness1 3 4. Temperature: The optimal range for infection and sporulation is 18-28Г‚В°C, with a minimum of 10Г‚В°C and a maximum of 35Г‚В°C3 4. Humidity: High humidity (\&gt;75%) and long periods of leaf wetness (\&gt;6 hours) favor the disease development1 3 4. Soil conditions: The soil conditions do not directly affect the disease, but they may influence the plant growth and resistance. Well-drained, fertile soils with adequate nitrogen and potassium levels can enhance plant vigor and reduce disease susceptibility1.
The overwintering method of this disease is by teliospores that form within the urediniospores on infected plant debris or seeds. The teliospores can survive for up to two years in the soil or on seed coats. They germinate in spring to produce basidiospores that infect alternate hosts (such as wood sorrel or oxalis) or primary hosts (such as beans) under favorable conditions1 3 4.
Fungicides can be used to protect the plants from infection, but they are not very effective once symptoms appear. The type, dose, period and frequency of application depend on the product label and local regulations. For example, one product recommends applying 0.5-1.5 kg/ha of mancozeb every 7-14 days1.
Infected plant parts should be removed and destroyed to prevent further spread of the disease. Infected seeds should not be used for planting2 1.
There is no effective biological control agent for this disease.
Crop rotation with non-host crops for at least two years can reduce the inoculum in the soil. Planting resistant varieties, if available, can also help prevent the disease. Avoiding overhead irrigation and high plant density can reduce the humidity and favor the disease development3 2 1.
["Leaves and pods develop pustules of red-brown powdery spores (urediniospores) that rupture the epidermis. They are often surrounded by a yellow halo3 2 4 1 5.", "Severely infected leaves turn chlorotic, dry and decline. They may drop off, resulting in defoliation3 2 1 5.", "Stems and branches may also develop pustules of spores, but less frequently than leaves and pods4."]
["Pustules of red-brown powdery spores (urediniospores) on leaves and pods are the most visible signs of the disease3 2 4 1 5.", "Later, black to brown spores (teliospores) form within the pustules and enable the fungus to survive between crop cycles and initiate new infections3 2 1 5.", "The fungus can be isolated from infected plant tissues and identified by microscopic examination or molecular techniques1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of bean rust, Uromyces appendiculatus, is mainly due to the presence of avirulence genes that encode for effectors that are recognized by the host plant's resistance genes1. The type and number of effectors vary among different strains of the fungus, and some strains may have virulence genes that can overcome the host resistance1. The level of resistance depends on the genetic diversity of both the host and the pathogen, as well as the environmental conditions2. 
A quick test for the phytopathogenic fungus of bean rust is to use a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that can detect the fungal DNA in infected plant samples. This method is rapid, sensitive, specific, and does not require expensive equipment or skilled personnel. 
The mechanism of infestation by the phytopathogenic fungus of bean rust is to produce urediniospores that are dispersed by wind or water to land on the host plant's leaves or pods3 4. The spores germinate and penetrate the plant tissue through stomata or wounds, and form haustoria that absorb nutrients from the plant cells3 4. The fungus then produces more urediniospores that erupt through the epidermis, forming rust-colored pustules surrounded by yellow halos3 4. The fungus can also produce teliospores that enable it to survive between crop cycles and initiate new infections3. 
Potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of bean rust are not well studied, as most research has focused on the fungal pathogen. However, some studies have suggested that some bacterial strains may have antagonistic effects on the fungus, such as producing antifungal compounds, competing for nutrients, or inducing systemic resistance in the host plant . Therefore, these bacteria may be used as biocontrol agents to reduce bean rust severity .
