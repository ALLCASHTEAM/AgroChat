Vegetable beans are a type of horticultural crop that are grown for human consumption1 2. Bacterial blight of vegetable beans is a bacterial disease that can be caused by different species of bacteria, such as Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli, Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae1 3.
The pathogenic bacteria of bacterial blight of vegetable beans do not have a fungal stage, so they do not reproduce by spores. They reproduce by binary fission, which is a process of cell division that produces two identical daughter cells4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of bacterial blight of vegetable beans vary depending on the bacterial species and environmental conditions. Generally, the bacteria can survive on infected seeds, plant debris, and weeds, and can be spread by rain splash, wind, insects, and mechanical means such as tools and human contact5 3 6.
The period of disease onset for bacterial blight of vegetable beans depends on the temperature and humidity levels, as well as the stage of plant growth. The disease can occur at any time during the growing season, but it is more likely to develop when the plants are young and the weather is warm and wet1 3 6. The environmental conditions required for bacterial blight of vegetable beans are high temperature (above 25Г‚В°C), high humidity (above 90%), and leaf wetness for several hours1 3 6. The disease can also be favored by poor drainage, overcrowding, and nutrient deficiency6.
The overwintering method of bacterial blight of vegetable beans is mainly through infected seeds that can carry the bacteria internally or externally1 3. The bacteria can also survive on plant debris and weeds in the soil or on the surface3.
Applying copper-based bactericides can help reduce the spread of the bacteria and protect healthy plants. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product label and the environmental conditions. Follow the label instructions carefully and avoid spraying when the plants are wet or stressed.
Removing and destroying infected plants or plant parts can help prevent further infection and reduce inoculum sources. Avoid wounding the plants or touching them when they are wet. Use clean tools and equipment and disinfect them between fields. Avoid overhead irrigation and improve drainage to reduce leaf wetness and humidity.
There are some biological agents that can antagonize or compete with the pathogenic bacteria, such as <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, <em>Pseudomonas fluorescens</em>, and <em>Streptomyces spp.</em> These agents can be applied as seed treatments or foliar sprays to enhance plant resistance and suppress bacterial growth. The effectiveness of biological control may depend on the bacterial strain, the plant variety, and the environmental factors.
Using disease-free seeds or certified seeds from western regions can help avoid introducing the bacteria into the field. Planting tolerant or resistant cultivars can reduce disease severity and yield losses. Using a crop rotation of 2 or more years between bean crops can help reduce soil inoculum levels. Eliminating alternate hosts such as volunteer beans and weeds can also help break the disease cycle.
["Leaf symptoms: Small water-soaked spots that become necrotic (brown or reddish) lesions of irregular shape with distinct yellow margins or halos. The lesions may enlarge, coalesce, and fall out giving the leaves a tattered appearance. The disease may become systemic and cause yellowing and death of new foliage.", "Pod symptoms: Similar water-soaked spots that enlarge into reddish brown lesions on the pod surface. The lesions may have a yellow or cream-colored bacterial exudate under moist conditions. The pods may become bent or twisted at the infection site. The seeds inside may abort or shrivel and discolor as they mature."]
["Bacterial exudate: A yellow or cream-colored sticky substance that oozes out from the infected tissues under humid conditions. The exudate may dry out and form crusts on the lesions.", "Bacterial cells: Rod-shaped bacteria that can be seen under a microscope in stained samples from infected tissues. The bacteria may have different characteristics depending on the species, such as motility, fluorescence, pigmentation, etc."]
Efflux pumps: These are membrane proteins that can pump out toxic substances such as antibiotics or plant antimicrobial compounds from the bacterial cell, reducing their intracellular concentration and inhibiting their action. Mutation or modification: These are changes in the bacterial DNA or proteins that can alter the target site or structure of the antibiotics or plant defense molecules, preventing them from binding or interfering with their function. Quorum sensing: This is a system of cell-to-cell communication that allows bacteria to coordinate their gene expression and behavior according to their population density and environmental cues. Quorum sensing can regulate the production of virulence factors, biofilm formation, stress response, and antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Horizontal gene transfer: This is the exchange of genetic material between bacteria through different mechanisms such as transformation, transduction, or conjugation. Horizontal gene transfer can introduce new genes or plasmids that encode for resistance traits or virulence factors into bacteria, enhancing their adaptability and fitness. Disease severity index (DSI): This is a method that involves scoring the symptoms of disease on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (dead plant) and calculating the percentage of diseased plants in a population. 
Immunofluorescence microscopy: This is a method that involves staining the bacteria with fluorescent antibodies that bind to specific antigens on their surface and observing them under a fluorescence microscope. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): This is a method that involves using antibodies coated on a solid surface to capture the bacteria from a sample and adding another antibody conjugated with an enzyme that produces a color change when exposed to a substrate. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): This is a method that involves amplifying specific regions of bacterial DNA using primers and a polymerase enzyme and detecting them by gel electrophoresis or hybridization probes. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP): This is a method that involves amplifying specific regions of bacterial DNA using primers and a polymerase enzyme under isothermal 
Attachment and entry: The bacteria attach to the plant surface by using different adhesins such as pili, flagella, or extracellular polysaccharides. The bacteria enter the plant through natural openings such as stomata or wounds caused by insects, pruning, or environmental stress. Movement and multiplication: The bacteria move and multiply within the plant intercellular spaces or vascular system by using different motility mechanisms such as flagella, type IV pili, or twitching motility. The bacteria can also form biofilms that protect them from environmental stress and host defenses. Virulence factor production: The bacteria produce and secrete different virulence factors that can facilitate their infection and cause damage to the plant cells. Some examples of virulence factors are1 2 3: Type III secretion system (T3SS): This is a molecular syringe that can inject bacterial proteins called effectors into the plant cells. The effectors can modulate different plant processes such as defense responses, hormone signaling, cell death, or metabolism to benefit the bacteria. Exopolysaccharides (EPS): These are complex sugars that can coat the bacterial cells and form a matrix for biofilm formation. The EPS can also interfere with plant defense responses by masking bacterial antigens or inducing hypersensitive reaction. Extracellular enzymes: These are enzymes that can degrade plant cell wall components such as cellulose, pectin, or lignin and facilitate bacterial entry and movement. Some examples of extracellular enzymes are cellulases, pectinases, or ligninases. Phytotoxins: These are toxins that can directly damage plant cells by disrupting their membrane integrity, enzyme activity, or metabolic pathways. Some examples of phytotoxins are coronatine, phaseolotoxin, or tabtoxin. 
Receptor-like kinases (<em>RLKs</em>): These are membrane proteins that can perceive different signals from the environment or from other cells and initiate signaling cascades that regulate plant processes such as growth, development, or defense. Some examples of <em>RLKs</em> are <em>FLS2</em>, <em>BAK1</em>, or <em>EFR</em>. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (<em>MAPKs</em>): These are cytoplasmic proteins that can act as signal transducers and modulate gene expression and protein activity in response to different stimuli such as pathogens, hormones, or stress. Some examples of <em>MAPKs</em> are <em>MPK3</em>, <em>MPK4</em>, or <em>MPK6</em>. Transcription factors (TFs): These are nuclear proteins that can bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate the expression of target genes involved in various plant processes such as growth, development, or defense. Some examples of TFs<em> </em>are <em>WRKYs</em>, <em>MYBs</em>, or <em>ERFs</em>. Hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways: These are metabolic pathways that can produce and perceive different hormones that regulate plant processes such as growth, development, or defense. Some examples of hormones are salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), auxin (IAA), or abscisic acid (ABA).
