Squash is a type of horticultural crop, which means it is grown for its edible fruits, flowers, or leaves. Squash belongs to the cucurbit family, which also includes cucumbers, melons, and pumpkins1. Squash powdery mildew is a type of fungal disease, caused by several different species of fungus. The most common species that affects squash foliage is Erysiphe cichoracearum1. Other species that can infect squash are Golovinomyces cucurbitacearum and Golovinomyces orontii2.
The pathogenic fungus of squash powdery mildew reproduces by producing conidia (asexual spores) and conidiophores (spore-bearing structures) on the surface of the infected leaves2. The conidia are easily dispersed by wind or air currents to other nearby plants or leaves3. Squash powdery mildew is a polycyclic disease, which means it can produce multiple cycles of infection and spore production within a single growing season4. The mode of transmission is mainly airborne, as the conidia are carried by wind or air currents to new hosts3. The fungus can also survive on plant debris or seeds and infect new plants the following season3.
Squash powdery mildew can occur at any time during the growing season, but it is more common and severe in late summer and early fall, when the weather is warm and dry1 3. The disease can also occur in greenhouses or other protected environments where humidity is high and air circulation is poor3. Squash powdery mildew thrives in warm (50-90 F or 10-32 C), dry, and shady conditions1 3. The fungus does not need free water on the leaf surface to germinate and infect, unlike most other fungal pathogens3. High relative humidity (&gt;95%) favors spore production and dispersal, while low humidity (&lt;40%) inhibits spore germination<sup>5</sup>. The disease is less severe in full sun exposure and high temperatures (&gt;100 F or 37 C)1 3.
Squash powdery mildew can overwinter as mycelium (fungal threads) or cleistothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) on plant debris or seeds3. The fungus can also survive on alternative hosts such as weeds or volunteer plants in the cucurbit family3.
Use fungicides that are labeled for powdery mildew on squash, such as sulfur, neem oil, potassium bicarbonate, or horticultural oils. Follow the label directions for dosage, application frequency, and pre-harvest interval. Apply fungicides before the disease appears or at the first sign of infection. Spray all plant parts thoroughly and repeat as needed1.
Remove and destroy infected plants or plant parts as soon as possible to reduce the spread of spores. Avoid overhead watering or water early in the day so the leaves have time to dry before nightfall. Increase air circulation around plants by thinning them out or pruning excess foliage1 2.
Use beneficial microorganisms that can suppress or compete with the fungus, such as Bacillus subtilis, Ampelomyces quisqualis, or Trichoderma harzianum. These products are available as commercial biofungicides or biocontrol agents. Follow the label directions for application and compatibility with other products1.
Plant resistant varieties of squash that are less susceptible to powdery mildew. Some examples are Butternut Supreme, Cornell Bush Delicata, Early Butternut Hybrid, Gold Nugget, Honey Bear, Royal Acorn Hybrid, Table Ace Hybrid, Table King Bush Acorn, and Waltham Butternut3 4. Rotate crops with non-host plants for at least two years to avoid soil-borne inoculum. Avoid planting squash near other cucurbits that can harbor the fungus. Use clean seeds or transplants that are free of powdery mildew1.

The phytopathogenic fungus of squash powdery mildew is Erysiphe cichoracearum1 2, which belongs to the group of obligate biotrophic fungi3. This means that it can only grow and reproduce on living host cells and cannot be cultured on artificial media3. The mechanism of resistance of this fungus is not fully understood, but some factors that may contribute to its survival and adaptation are: genetic diversity, sexual reproduction, host range expansion, effector proteins, and suppression of host defense responses. The type of resistance agent that the fungus uses is mainly its spores, which are produced in large numbers and can be dispersed by wind to infect new plants2. The level of resistance of the fungus depends on the environmental conditions, the host genotype, and the presence of other pathogens. 
A quick test for the phytopathogenic fungus of squash powdery mildew is to examine the leaves of the infected plants under a magnifying glass or a microscope. You should be able to see the characteristic white or gray powdery coating on the surface of the leaves, which consists of fungal hyphae and spores2. You can also try to rub off some of the powdery material with your finger or a cloth. If it comes off easily, it is likely powdery mildew. Another test is to spray water on the infected leaves. If the water beads up and does not wet the surface, it is likely powdery mildew. 
The mechanism of infestation by the phytopathogenic fungus of squash powdery mildew is through a process called haustorium formation. A haustorium is a specialized structure that the fungus uses to penetrate and feed on the host cell without killing it. The fungus first lands on the leaf surface and germinates to form a germ tube. The germ tube then grows along the leaf surface until it finds a suitable site for infection, usually a stomata (a pore on the leaf surface) or a trichome (a hair-like projection on the leaf surface). The germ tube then forms an appressorium (a flattened structure that adheres to the leaf surface) and produces a penetration peg that pierces through the cuticle and cell wall of the host cell. The penetration peg then expands into a haustorium inside the host cell, where it absorbs nutrients and suppresses host defense responses. The fungus then produces more hyphae and spores on the leaf surface, forming the powdery mildew colony. The type and number of pathogenic effectors that the fungus uses to manipulate the host cell are not well known, but some examples are: Ecp6, which inhibits chitin-triggered immunity in plants; CSEP0064, which interferes with salicylic acid-mediated defense signaling in plants; and CSEP0105, which induces cell death in plants. The differences in infestation of different plants by the fungus depend on the compatibility between the fungal genotype and the host genotype, as well as other factors such as environmental conditions, plant age, plant health, and plant resistance genes. 
Potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of squash powdery mildew are not clear, as there is no evidence that bacteria are involved in this disease. However, some studies have suggested that certain bacteria may have beneficial effects on plants infected by powdery mildew, such as: Bacillus subtilis, which can induce systemic acquired resistance in plants; Pseudomonas fluorescens, which can produce antifungal compounds and compete with fungal pathogens; and Streptomyces spp., which can enhance plant growth and immunity. These bacteria may be used as biocontrol agents or biofertilizers to reduce powdery mildew severity and improve plant health.
