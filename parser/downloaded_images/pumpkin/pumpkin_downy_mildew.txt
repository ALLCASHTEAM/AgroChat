Pumpkin is a type of horticultural crop, which means it is grown for its edible or ornamental value1. Downy mildew of pumpkin is a type of oomycete disease, which means it is caused by a water mold that is related to algae, not fungi2. The causal agent of downy mildew of pumpkin is Pseudoperonospora cubensis3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic oomycete of downy mildew of pumpkin is by producing sporangia, which are sac-like structures that contain zoospores, which are mobile spores that can swim in water and infect new plants2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of downy mildew of pumpkin are influenced by weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and cloudiness4. The sporangia are produced on the undersides of the leaves when conditions are humid and night-time temperatures are between 55 В°F and 75 В°F3. The sporangia are then dispersed by wind or rain to new plants, where they release zoospores that can infect the leaves if there is enough free moisture3. The disease can spread rapidly within a field or region if the conditions are favorable3.
The period of disease onset for downy mildew of pumpkin depends on the source and timing of inoculum, as well as the environmental conditions3. The oomycete does not survive the winter in the Midwest and must be re-introduced each year from other regions or hosts3. Counties in northern Ohio and southeast Michigan appear to bear the brunt of early introductions from the north (possibly from northern cucumber production greenhouses), while areas further south generally donвЂ™t see the disease until late July or August3. The disease can appear earlier or later depending on the weather patterns and the movement of sporangia3. The environmental conditions required for downy mildew of pumpkin are high humidity, moderate temperatures, and leaf wetness2 3. The optimal temperature range for infection is 41В° to 82 В°F, with 59В° to 68 В°F being ideal2. The minimum leaf wetness duration for infection is two to six hours2. The disease is more severe in shaded areas or under cloudy skies than in sunny areas2.
The overwintering method of downy mildew of pumpkin is by surviving on living cucurbit tissue in regions where frost does not occur, such as southern states or greenhouses2 3. The oomycete can also produce oospores, which are thick-walled sexual spores that can survive in plant debris or soil for a long time, but their role in disease epidemiology is not well understood2.
There are no effective pesticide products for downy mildew available to home gardeners1. However, commercial growers can use fungicides such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper-based products2. Fungicides should be applied at the 'bush stage' of the pumpkin plant, shortly before vining starts3.
Use drip irrigation and wide row spacing to dry the leaves and encourage good air movement around the plants1. Trellis plants to improve air circulation4. Remove plants with symptoms of disease1.
There are no known biological agents that can effectively control downy mildew on pumpkins.
Select growing sites with good drainage and airflow, full sunlight and low humidity2. Avoid overhead irrigation to prevent leaf wetness2. Ensure adequate, but not excessive fertility2. Plant resistant varieties4 3. Practice crop rotation4.
["Yellow spots on the upper leaf surface between the leaf veins5. These spots spread everywhere but the veins and eventually turn brown5.", "The plant cannot photosynthesize on these yellow or brown spots5.", "When the leaf is totally brown, it drops5.", "The exposed pumpkins can be scalded by the sun, ripen poorly, and grow to be much smaller than expected5.", "Flower buds can also be infected which will prevent them from opening and they'll dry and fall off the plant4."]
["A fuzz on the bottom of the leaf surface that varies from white to purple, depending on the species of mildew5. This fuzz consists of a combination of fungal spores and threads known as mycelia5.", "The vascular system of the plant is totally choked with spores, making it impossible for the plant to transport water from the roots to the leaves5."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of pumpkin downy mildew is Pseudoperonospora cubensis1. It has a high level of genetic diversity and can produce different pathotypes that can overcome host resistance. The mechanism of resistance involves the production of effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in the host plant, which is activated by the recognition of specific fungal effectors by plant resistance genes. The type of resistance agent is usually a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein that can bind to the fungal effector and trigger a defense response. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of pumpkin downy mildew is the immunostrip test, which can detect the presence of the fungus in plant tissue samples within 10 minutes. The test uses a lateral flow device that contains antibodies specific to P. cubensis and produces a colored line when the fungus is present. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of pumpkin downy mildew involves the germination of fungal spores on the leaf surface and the penetration of the leaf tissue by haustoria, which are specialized structures that extract nutrients from the host cells. The fungus produces a variety of pathogenic effectors that can suppress plant immunity, manipulate host metabolism, and modulate host cell death. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the fungal strain and the host species. For example, some effectors are specific to cucumbers, while others are effective on pumpkins and squash. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility between the fungal effectors and the plant resistance genes, as well as other factors such as environmental conditions and plant physiology. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of pumpkin downy mildew are not well known, as there is no evidence that P. cubensis is associated with any bacterial symbionts or pathogens. However, some studies have identified some genes that are essential for fungal growth and pathogenicity, such as genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, signal transduction, metabolic pathways, and effector secretion . These genes could be potential targets for developing novel fungicides or genetic engineering strategies to control pumpkin downy mildew.
