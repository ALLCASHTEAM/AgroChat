Leeks are a type of horticultural crop that belongs to the Allium genus, along with onions, garlic, chives, and scallions1. Leek fertilizer damage is a type of physiological disease that occurs when leeks are over-fertilized or exposed to high levels of magnesium oxide2.
Leek fertilizer damage is not caused by a pathogenic fungus, so it does not have a mode of reproduction. Leek fertilizer damage is not transmitted by any agent, but it is influenced by environmental factors such as soil pH, moisture, and nutrient availability3.
Leek fertilizer damage can occur at any stage of growth, but it is more likely to affect young plants or plants that are stressed by drought or cold2. Leek fertilizer damage can be prevented by using a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of about 14-14-13 and less than one percent magnesium oxide2. Leeks also prefer a soil pH of 6.0 to 6.8 and consistent moisture4.
Leek fertilizer damage does not have an overwintering method, as it is not caused by a living organism.
There is no specific chemical agent recommended for leek fertilizer damage, but some general guidelines are to avoid over-fertilizing, especially with nitrogen-rich fertilizers, and to use organic or slow-release fertilizers instead of synthetic ones. Excess nitrogen can cause leeks to grow too fast and become susceptible to diseases and pests. It can also cause leaf burn and root rot1.
One way to prevent leek fertilizer damage is to blanch the leeks by covering the lower part of the stem with soil, mulch, or cardboard tubes. This will reduce the exposure of the leeks to sunlight and prevent them from turning green and bitter. Blanching can also help retain moisture and nutrients in the soil2.
There is no specific biological control for leek fertilizer damage, but some beneficial organisms can help improve the soil health and reduce the risk of diseases and pests. For example, earthworms can aerate the soil and break down organic matter, while mycorrhizal fungi can enhance the root system and nutrient uptake of leeks2.
Some cultural practices can help prevent leek fertilizer damage, such as crop rotation, intercropping, weed control, irrigation, and harvesting. Crop rotation can prevent the buildup of soil-borne pathogens and pests that affect leeks. Intercropping can increase the diversity and resilience of the crop system and provide beneficial effects such as pest suppression, nitrogen fixation, or soil improvement. Weed control can reduce the competition for water and nutrients and prevent the spread of diseases and pests. Irrigation can maintain a consistent soil moisture level and avoid water stress or waterlogging. Harvesting can be done when the leeks are mature enough but not overgrown, as they may become tough and woody2.
["Leek fertilizer damage can cause various symptoms depending on the type and amount of fertilizer applied, the soil condition, and the environmental factors. Some common symptoms are:", "Leaf burn: This is caused by excess salts in the soil or on the leaf surface due to over-fertilization or evaporation. The leaves may turn brown, yellow, or white at the tips or edges and become dry and brittle1.", "Root rot: This is caused by fungal or bacterial infections due to poor drainage or overwatering. The roots may turn brown, black, or soft and decayed. The plants may wilt, yellow, or die1.", "Bolting: This is caused by stress due to high temperature, drought, or over-fertilization. The plants may produce flower stalks prematurely and stop growing leaves. The bulbs may become small, hard, or woody2."]
["Leek fertilizer damage does not have specific disease signs, as it is not caused by a pathogen itself but by an imbalance of nutrients in the soil or plant tissue. However, some signs of diseases or pests that may be associated with leek fertilizer damage are:", "Leek rust: This is caused by a fungus that produces orange-brown pustules on the leaves and stems. It can reduce the yield and quality of leeks2.", "Downy mildew: This is caused by a fungus that produces white-gray fuzzy growth on the lower surface of the leaves. It can cause leaf blight and distortion2.", "Powdery mildew: This is caused by a fungus that produces white powdery spots on the upper surface of the leaves. It can reduce photosynthesis and growth2.", "White-tip disease: This is caused by a fungus that produces white lesions on the tips of the leaves. It can reduce the marketability of leeks2.", "Botrytis leaf blight: This is caused by a fungus that produces gray-brown spots on the leaves that may coalesce into large patches. It can cause leaf dieback and rotting2.", "Leek moth: This is caused by a moth that lays eggs on the leaves and stems of leeks. The larvae feed on the plant tissue and create holes and tunnels. They can cause severe damage and crop loss2.", "Thrips: These are tiny insects that suck sap from the leaves and stems of leeks. They can cause silvering, streaking, curling, or distortion of the leaves2.", "Onion maggots: These are fly larvae that bore into the bulbs of leeks. They can cause rotting, wilting, or death of the plants2."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of leek fertility disease is Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which belongs to the class Leotiomycetes and causes white mold on various crops1. This fungus can detoxify plant glucosinolate hydrolysis products, which are toxic compounds produced by Brassicales plants, via an isothiocyanate hydrolase that hydrolyzes isothiocyanates to amines1. This enzyme is homologous to a bacterial enzyme and confers resistance to the fungus against the plant defense1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the type and concentration of isothiocyanates and the fungal strain1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of leek fertility disease is to use a selective medium that contains pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) and rose bengal2. This medium inhibits the growth of most other fungi and bacteria, while allowing S. sclerotiorum to grow and produce characteristic white mycelia and black sclerotia2. The medium can be prepared by adding 0.1 g of PCNB and 0.05 g of rose bengal to 1 L of potato dextrose agar (PDA)2. The medium can be inoculated with fungal spores or tissue samples from infected plants and incubated at 20В°C for 3-5 days2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of leek fertility disease is that S. sclerotiorum produces oxalic acid and polygalacturonases that degrade the plant cell wall and cause tissue maceration3. Oxalic acid also suppresses the plant immune response by inhibiting callose deposition and salicylic acid signaling3. The fungus also produces necrosis-inducing proteins that trigger cell death and facilitate fungal colonization3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain and the host plant3. For example, S. sclerotiorum has more effectors that target jasmonic acid signaling than salicylic acid signaling, which may explain its preference for dicotyledonous plants over monocotyledonous plants3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of leek fertility disease are not well known, as there are no reports of bacterial pathogens causing this disease. However, some studies have suggested that ethylene signaling may modulate the susceptibility of Arabidopsis thaliana to S. sclerotiorum infection. Ethylene is a plant hormone that regulates various aspects of plant growth and development, as well as stress responses. Ethylene signaling may enhance the expression of genes involved in cell wall reinforcement, oxidative stress tolerance, and defense-related enzymes. Ethylene may also antagonize jasmonic acid signaling, which is important for resistance against necrotrophic pathogens like S. sclerotiorum. Therefore, genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, perception, and signaling may be potential targets for manipulating the plant resistance to leek fertility disease.
