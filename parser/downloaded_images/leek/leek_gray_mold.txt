Leek is a horticultural crop that belongs to the <em>Allium</em> genus, along with onion, garlic, and chives1. Leek gray mold is a fungal disease caused by the fungus <em>Botrytis cinerea</em>2 3, which can infect over 200 species of plants .
The pathogenic fungus of leek gray mold reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or water . The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of leek gray mold are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The disease is more severe in cool and damp conditions, and it can spread by airborne or waterborne conidia that infect wounded or senescent plant tissues. The fungus can also survive as <em>sclerotia</em>, which are hard structures that can overwinter in the soil or plant debris and germinate into new conidia when conditions are favorable.
The period of disease onset for leek gray mold depends on the host plant, the stage of growth, and the environmental conditions. Generally, the disease can occur at any time during the growing season, but it is more common during flowering and fruiting stages, when the plant tissues are more susceptible to infection . The environmental conditions required for leek gray mold are cool (10-20В°C) and humid (\&gt;90% relative humidity) weather, with frequent rainfall or irrigation that keeps the plant surfaces wet for long periods . The fungus can also grow on a wide range of soil types, but it prefers soils with high organic matter and good drainage.
The overwintering method of leek gray mold is by forming <em>sclerotia</em>, which can persist in the soil or plant debris for several years and germinate into new conidia when conditions are favorable .
Chemical control: Fungicides such as copper soap1, neem oil2, or potassium bicarbonate-based fungicides2 can be applied at the start of flowering and every 7-10 days until harvest to protect plants from disease spores. Mycostop, a biological fungicide approved for organic use, can also be sprayed every 2-3 weeks to suppress the disease1.
Physical measures: Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation between plants and reduce humidity2 1. Cut off and dispose of any infected parts of the plant1. Do not compost infected plant material or leave it on the soil surface2 1.
Biological control: Beneficial microorganisms such as <em>Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma</em>, and <em>Cladosporium</em> can compete with or inhibit the growth of the fungus2 1. Mycostop contains a strain of <em>Streptomyces griseoviridis</em> that acts as a biofungicide1.
Agricultural control: Use resistant varieties of leeks or onions if available2. Avoid overhead watering or water in the early morning hours to allow plants to dry out during the day2 1. Add organic compost or mulch under plants to prevent fungal spores from splashing up onto leaves and flowers2. Clean up garden areas in the fall to reduce overwintering sites for the fungus2.
["Grayish colored soft, mushy spots on leaves, stems, flowers and produce2 1.", "Spots may become covered with a coating of gray fungus spores, especially if humidity is high2 1.", "Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop black, stone-like sclerotia under rotted parts2 1.", "When inner petals or the middle of the petals develop brown lesions first, gray mold is probably the reason3.", "On leaves that are relatively thin such as redbud, lesions are light brown to brown and irregular3.", "On fleshier leaves such as rhododendrons concentric rings of different shades of brown may be visible3."]

The phytopathogenic fungus of gray mold of leeks is <em>Botrytis cinerea</em>, which can cause significant losses in crops and post-harvest storage. This fungus has a high degree of genetic diversity and can adapt to different environmental conditions and host plants1. It can also develop resistance to various fungicides, such as benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, phenylpyrroles, anilinopyrimidines, and quinone outside inhibitors2. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in target genes, overexpression of efflux pumps or detoxification enzymes, and epigenetic changes2. The level of resistance depends on the fungicide group, the fungal strain, and the host plant2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of gray mold of leeks is the microscopic examination of spores or <em>sclerotia</em>. Spores are grayish-brown, oval-shaped, and have one or two oil droplets inside. Sclerotia are black, hard, and irregularly shaped structures that form on infected plant tissues1. To perform the test, one can collect samples of symptomatic plant parts, place them on a moist paper towel in a plastic bag, and incubate them at room temperature for a few days until spores or sclerotia appear. Then, one can use a microscope to observe the spores or sclerotia and compare them with reference images3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of gray mold of leeks is the infection of plant tissues by spores or sclerotia of Botrytis cinerea. The fungus can infect plants through natural openings (such as stomata or wounds), or by directly penetrating the cuticle or cell wall with appressoria (specialized infection structures)2. The fungus produces various pathogenic effectors, such as enzymes (cutinases, pectinases, cellulases), toxins (botrydial, botcinic acid), and small secreted proteins (necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptides)2. These effectors help the fungus to degrade plant cell walls, suppress plant defense responses, induce cell death, and manipulate plant hormone signaling2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the fungal strain and the host plant2. For example, some strains can infect a wide range of plants (polyphagous), while others are more specific to certain hosts (monophagous or oligophagous)2. Some plants are more susceptible to gray mold than others, depending on their genetic and environmental factors1.
