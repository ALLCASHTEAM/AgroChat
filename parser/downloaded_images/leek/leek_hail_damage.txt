Leek is a horticultural crop that belongs to the Allium genus, along with onion, garlic, and chives1. Hail damage is not a disease, but a physical injury caused by hailstones that can affect the leaves, stems, and bulbs of leek plants. Hail damage can also increase the susceptibility of leek plants to fungal and bacterial diseases, such as purple blotch, downy mildew, and soft rot1 2.
The pathogenic fungi that can infect leek plants after hail damage have different modes of reproduction. For example, Alternaria porri, the causal agent of purple blotch, produces conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind and rain3. Peronospora destructor, the causal agent of downy mildew, produces sporangia (asexual spores) that are also dispersed by wind and rain. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of fungal and bacterial diseases of leek plants depend on the pathogen, the environmental conditions, and the host resistance. Generally, these diseases are favored by high humidity, moderate to cool temperatures, and wet foliage. They are transmitted by airborne spores or bacteria that can infect wounded or healthy tissues4 .
The period of disease onset for fungal and bacterial diseases of leek plants varies depending on the pathogen and the environmental conditions. For example, purple blotch can appear within 3 to 5 days after infection, while downy mildew can take up to 14 days to develop symptoms3 . Soft rot can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during storage or transit. The environmental conditions required for fungal and bacterial diseases of leek plants are similar to those that favor hail formation: high humidity, moderate to cool temperatures, and wet foliage. However, some pathogens have specific requirements for optimal infection. For example, purple blotch is more severe at temperatures between 15В°C and 24В°C, while downy mildew is more severe at temperatures below 18В°C3 . Soft rot is more severe at temperatures above 25В°C.
The overwintering method of fungal and bacterial diseases of leek plants depends on the pathogen and the availability of host tissues. Some pathogens can survive on infected plant debris or seeds in the soil or on weeds. For example, Alternaria porri can overwinter on infected onion or leek residues or seeds3. Peronospora destructor can overwinter as oospores (sexual spores) in the soil or on infected plant debris. Some pathogens can also survive in alternative hosts or vectors. For example, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, the causal agent of soft rot, can overwinter in insects or nematodes that feed on infected plant tissues.
Some studies have suggested that applying plant growth regulators (PGRs) such as gibberellic acid (GA3) or cytokinins can enhance the recovery of hail-damaged plants by stimulating cell division and elongation1. However, the effectiveness of PGRs may depend on the timing, dose, and frequency of application, as well as the crop species and the severity of hail damage1. PGRs may also have negative effects on crop quality and yield if applied incorrectly1.
Some physical measures that can protect crops from hail damage include using hail nets, plastic films, or mulches to cover the plants or reduce the impact of hailstones1. However, these measures may also have drawbacks such as high cost, labor intensity, reduced light transmission, or increased pest and disease incidence1.
I could not find any information on biological control methods for leek hail damage or hail damage in general.
Some agricultural practices that can reduce the risk or severity of hail damage include selecting resistant or tolerant crop varieties, adjusting planting dates or densities, applying adequate irrigation and fertilization, and implementing crop rotation or intercropping1.
["Bruising: Hailstones can cause bruises or lesions on the leaves or stems of leek plants, which may appear as dark green, brown, or black spots or streaks2. Bruising can reduce the photosynthetic capacity and marketability of leek plants2.", "Shredding: Hailstones can also cause shredding or tearing of the leaves or stems of leek plants, which may expose the inner tissues to air and water loss2. Shredding can also increase the susceptibility of leek plants to secondary infections by pathogens or pests2.", "Breaking: Hailstones can also cause breaking or snapping of the leaves or stems of leek plants, which may result in complete loss of plant parts or reduced plant growth2. Breaking can also affect the quality and yield of leek plants2."]
["Fungal substrates: Some fungal pathogens that can infect hail-damaged leek plants include Botrytis spp., Fusarium spp., Alternaria spp., and Sclerotinia spp.3. These fungi can produce visible substrates such as spores, mycelia, sclerotia, or fruiting bodies on the affected plant parts3. Fungal infections can cause symptoms such as leaf blight, stem rot, bulb rot, or white mold3.", "Bacterial secretions: Some bacterial pathogens that can infect hail-damaged leek plants include Pseudomonas spp., Xanthomonas spp., Erwinia spp., and Dickeya spp.3. These bacteria can produce secretions such as ooze, slime, exudate, or water-soaked lesions on the affected plant parts3. Bacterial infections can cause symptoms such as leaf spot, soft rot, wilting, or blackleg3.", "Insect frass: Some insect pests that can infest hail-damaged leek plants include thrips, aphids, leafminers, onion maggots, and cutworms3. These insects can produce frass such as fecal pellets, honeydew, silk threads, or tunnels on the affected plant parts3. Insect infestations can cause symptoms such as leaf curling, yellowing, distortion, mining, or feeding damage3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of hail damage in leeks is not well studied, but some related information can be found for other fungal pathogens of leeks or other Brassicales plants. For example, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, a necrotrophic fungus that causes white mold on leeks and other crops, can detoxify plant glucosinolate hydrolysis products, such as isothiocyanates, via two independent pathways: conjugation to glutathione and hydrolysis to amines1. The latter pathway involves an isothiocyanate hydrolase that converts isothiocyanate into products that are not toxic to the fungus1. Another example is Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae, a soil-borne fungus that causes basal rot of leeks and onions. This fungus can overcome plant resistance by producing secreted in xylem (SIX) effectors that suppress plant defense responses and facilitate fungal colonization. The SIX effectors are encoded by genes that are located in transposable elements and can undergo frequent rearrangements, leading to variation in effector repertoire and virulence among fungal isolates. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of hail damage in leeks may depend on the type and identity of the fungus. However, some general methods that can be used to detect fungal pathogens in plants include microscopic examination, culturing, immunological assays, and molecular techniques. Microscopic examination involves observing fungal structures or spores on plant tissues using a microscope. Culturing involves isolating fungal pathogens from plant tissues and growing them on artificial media. Immunological assays involve using antibodies that bind to specific fungal antigens and produce a color change or a signal. Molecular techniques involve using DNA or RNA probes that hybridize to specific fungal sequences and produce a fluorescent or radioactive signal. Some examples of molecular techniques are polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and DNA microarrays. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of hail damage in leeks may also depend on the type and identity of the fungus. However, some general steps that are involved in fungal pathogenesis of plants are attachment, penetration, invasion, colonization, and reproduction. Attachment involves the recognition and adhesion of fungal spores or hyphae to the plant surface. Penetration involves the breaching of the plant cuticle or cell wall by mechanical or enzymatic means. Invasion involves the growth and spread of fungal hyphae inside the plant tissues, either intercellularly or intracellularly. Colonization involves the establishment and maintenance of a compatible interaction between the fungus and the plant, either biotrophic or necrotrophic. Reproduction involves the formation and dissemination of fungal spores or other propagules from the infected plant. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of hail damage in leeks are not clear, as bacterial pathogens are not commonly associated with this disease. However, some possible targets that have been identified for other bacterial pathogens of plants include plant cell wall components, such as pectin, cellulose, and lignin; plant hormones, such as auxin, ethylene, and salicylic acid; plant defense proteins, such as pathogenesis-related proteins, resistance proteins, and antimicrobial peptides; and plant signaling molecules, such as jasmonic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species. Bacterial pathogens can target these molecules by producing enzymes that degrade them, toxins that inhibit them, effectors that manipulate them, or mimics that interfere with them.
