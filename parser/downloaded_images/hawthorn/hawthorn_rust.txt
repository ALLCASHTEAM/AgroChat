Hawthorn is a type of horticultural crop that is grown for its ornamental value, edible fruits and medicinal properties1. Hawthorn rust is a type of fungal disease that is caused by a pathogen called Gymnosporangium globosum2 1.
The pathogenic fungus of Hawthorn rust reproduces by producing teliospores on juniper hosts and aeciospores on hawthorn hosts1. Teliospores are thick-walled spores that germinate to form basidiospores, which are wind-dispersed and infect hawthorn leaves and fruits. Aeciospores are thin-walled spores that are also wind-dispersed and infect juniper needles and twigs3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of Hawthorn rust is airborne. The disease requires two different hosts, juniper and hawthorn, to complete its life cycle. The fungus alternates between producing teliospores on juniper and aeciospores on hawthorn, which are carried by the wind to infect new hosts4 3.
The period of disease onset for Hawthorn rust varies depending on the host and the environmental conditions. On juniper, the disease causes small galls to form on needles and twigs, which may take up to two years to mature and produce teliospores1. On hawthorn, the disease causes yellow to orange spots to appear on leaves and fruits, which may develop into tubes (aecia) by mid-summer1 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are moisture and warmth. The fungus needs wet weather to produce and release spores, and optimal temperatures for infection range from 50Г‚В°F to 75Г‚В°F (10Г‚В°C to 24Г‚В°C)1 3. The disease is more severe in areas where juniper and hawthorn are planted close together or where there is poor air circulation around the trees2 1.
The overwintering method of this disease is dormant galls on juniper hosts. The fungus survives in the galls until the next spring, when they swell and produce telial horns that release basidiospores1 3.
One of the most effective ways to prevent and control Hawthorn rust is to avoid planting junipers near hawthorns, as they are alternate hosts for the fungus that causes the disease1 2.
Physical measures such as cutting off infected parts of hawthorns can help reduce the severity of the disease, but may not eliminate it completely3.
Biological control and agricultural control methods for Hawthorn rust are not well documented on the web, so I do not have information on them.

["Hawthorn rust causes small yellow spots to appear on the leaves of hawthorns after infection in spring2. As the spots mature and enlarge, they take on an orange color and develop tiny black dots (spermagonia) in the center of the lesion2.", "By mid-summer, tubes (aecia) are visible on the undersides of mature leaf lesions or within the lesions on fruit, petioles, or twigs infections2. Hawthorn rust aecia are longer than the aecia of cedar-apple rust2.", "With severe rust, hawthorn foliage may turn bright yellow and drop prematurely2. In addition, fruit and young shoots may become infected2.", "The symptoms vary when other hosts are infected. On quince, black flat lesions (without aecia) form on fruit2. Dark brown to blackish spots with reddish halos form on the upper surface of pear leaves2. In addition, aecia may develop on the petioles and lower surface of pear leaves2."]
["The disease signs of Hawthorn rust are mainly visible on the evergreen hosts, such as junipers. The fungus produces reddish-brown galls on twigs and small branches of susceptible junipers2. After reaching a diameter of about 1/8 to 1/2 inch, circular dimple-like scars appear on the surface of the galls2.", "When mature, these galls swell and produce reddish-brown, short, blunt, jelly-like telial horns during rainy spring weather2. These horns release basidiospores that infect deciduous hosts like hawthorns2.", "In contrast to cedar-apple rust galls, cedar-hawthorn rust galls seldom cause the death of infected evergreen twigs2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some reports suggest that it may have multiple mechanisms of resistance, such as detoxification of host defense compounds, suppression of host immunity, and modification of fungal cell wall. The type and level of resistance agent are unknown, but some possible candidates are cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases, and ABC transporters. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with specific primers that target the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the fungal ribosomal DNA. This method can detect the presence of the fungus in infected plant tissues within a few hours. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the production and release of basidiospores from the telial horns on the evergreen host (juniper) that infect the deciduous host (hawthorn) during rainy spring weather1. The fungus then forms small yellow spots on hawthorn leaves that later develop into orange lesions with tiny black dots (spermagonia) and tubes (aecia)1. The aeciospores from the aecia then infect susceptible evergreen hosts from midsummer to early fall1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but some studies suggest that they may include small secreted proteins (SSPs) that modulate host responses and facilitate infection. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host susceptibility, environmental conditions, and genetic diversity of the fungus. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are unclear, as there is no evidence of bacterial involvement in this disease. Hawthorn rust is caused by a fungal pathogen, not a bacterial one2 3 1.
