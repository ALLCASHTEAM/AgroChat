Peanut is a type of oil and economic crop1. Peanut black spot mixed with scorch spot is a type of fungal disease caused by two different fungi: Nothopassalora personata (previously known as Cercosporidium personatum) causes late leaf spot and Passalora arachidicola (previously known as Cercospora arachidicola) causes early leaf spot2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungi of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by weather conditions and cropping history. Leaf spot diseases are most severe where peanuts are grown in the same field in consecutive years, and when periods of wet weather from rain, dew or high humidity are frequent3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions, but symptoms usually appear between 30 to 50 days after planting4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, warm temperatures (between 20В°C and 30В°C), and long periods of leaf wetness (more than 12 hours per day)2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris or on alternative hosts such as weeds or volunteer peanuts2.
Fungicides can be applied during optimum conditions for disease occurrence and spread. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect depend on the specific product and label instructions1.
Cutting off the infected parts may help reduce the inoculum and disease spread2.
Enrichment of beneficial microorganisms in the rhizosphere may improve the resistance of peanuts to soil-borne pathogens3.
Crop rotation, canopy and water management, and resistant cultivars may help in reducing disease symptoms and severity1 2 4.
["Early leaf spot: Brown to dark brown, circular spots with a distinct yellow border or halo on the upper leaf surface; brown spots on the lower leaf surface; defoliation of diseased leaflets2.", "Late leaf spot: Black, circular spots with or without a yellow halo on the upper leaf surface; dark brown to black spots on the lower leaf surface; defoliation of diseased leaflets2.", "Scorch spot: Small, irregularly shaped brown spots with dark margins on both leaf surfaces; spots may coalesce to form large necrotic areas; defoliation of diseased leaflets1."]
["Early leaf spot: Tufts of silvery, hair-like spores on lesions during humid weather; spores can be seen on the upper lesion surface with a magnifying glass or cellphone close-up2.", "Late leaf spot: Masses of dark spores on lesions during humid weather; spores can be seen on the lower lesion surface as a velvety appearance without magnification2.", "Scorch spot: No visible signs of the pathogen on the lesions1."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus may have mechanisms to detoxify or degrade the fungicides, to modify the target site of the fungicides, or to reduce the uptake or increase the efflux of the fungicides. Type of resistance agent: The fungus may develop resistance to different classes of fungicides, such as benzimidazoles, demethylation inhibitors, quinone outside inhibitors, or succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors. Level of resistance: The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide dose, frequency, and timing, as well as the fungal population and genetic diversity. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungi of the disease is to use a molecular diagnostic tool such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the specific DNA sequences of the fungi from infected plant samples. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungi may produce various effectors that can manipulate the host plant's defense responses, such as toxins, enzymes, or small secreted proteins. The number and diversity of effectors may influence the virulence and host range of the fungi. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungi may have different degrees of compatibility with different plant species or cultivars, depending on the presence or absence of specific resistance or susceptibility genes in the host plants. Some plants may have innate immunity or induced resistance to the fungi. 
Knockout lethal genes: These are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of the fungi, and their disruption or deletion would result in fungal death or reduced fitness. Some examples of knockout lethal genes in other fungal pathogens are those involved in cell wall biosynthesis, ergosterol biosynthesis, DNA replication, or mitochondrial function. Host susceptibility genes: These are genes that are required for the host plant's susceptibility to the fungi, and their mutation or silencing would result in enhanced resistance or tolerance to the disease. Some examples of host susceptibility genes in other plant-fungal interactions are those involved in hormone signaling, transcriptional regulation, or membrane transport.
