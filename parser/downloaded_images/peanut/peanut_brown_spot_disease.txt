Peanut is a type of cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds1 2. Peanut brown spot disease is a type of fungal disease caused by the fungus Cercospora arachidicola3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain2 4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop rotation. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions, and in fields where peanuts are grown continuously or with short rotations. The conidia of the fungus can infect the leaves and stems of the peanut plants through natural openings or wounds, and can also survive on crop residues or weeds5 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the weather and the cultivar of peanut. The symptoms usually appear between 30 to 50 days after planting, but can also occur later in the season1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30В°C), high humidity (above 90%), and frequent rainfall. These conditions favor the germination and infection of the conidia, and the development and spread of the disease2 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris or alternative hosts such as weeds or other legumes. The fungus can also produce sclerotia, which are hard masses of fungal tissue that can persist in the soil for long periods2 4.
Applying fungicides such as chlorothalonil, tebuconazole, propiconazole, or pyraclostrobin at regular intervals (usually every 14 days) starting from 30 to 45 days after planting or when the first symptoms appear. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label, the disease severity, and the weather conditions. The control effect of fungicides can vary from 50% to 90%, depending on the resistance of the fungus and the coverage of the spray1 2 3.
Removing and destroying infected plant debris or burying them deeply in the soil to reduce the inoculum source. Pruning or cutting off the infected parts of the plant to prevent further spread of the disease1 3.
Using antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, or Pseudomonas fluorescens to inhibit the growth and infection of the fungus. These biocontrol agents can be applied as seed treatments, soil amendments, or foliar sprays1 3.
Rotating peanuts with other crops such as corn, sorghum, cotton, or soybean for at least two years to reduce the inoculum level in the soil. Avoiding planting peanuts in fields with a history of severe leaf spot disease or sclerotinia blight. Planting resistant or tolerant cultivars of peanut such as Georgia-06G, Georgia-07W, Georgia-09B, or Tifguard. Avoiding excessive irrigation or fertilization that can favor disease development. Improving air circulation and light penetration in the canopy by using appropriate row spacing and plant density4 1 3.
["This disease are brown or black spots on the leaves and stems of the peanut plants.", "The spots may have a yellow halo around them and can coalesce to form large necrotic areas.", "The spots can penetrate through the leaf and are visible on both surfaces.", "The infected leaves may turn yellow, curl up, and fall off prematurely.", "The defoliation can reduce photosynthesis, pod formation, and yield4 1 5."]
["This disease are spores of the fungus that can be seen on the spots under humid conditions.", "The spores are produced in structures called conidiophores that emerge from the stomata or wounds on the leaf surface.", "The spores are silvery-gray for early leaf spot and dark-brown to black for late leaf spot.", "The spores can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope4 1 5."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is mainly related to the fungicide resistance that the fungus can develop over time. The mechanism of resistance involves the alteration of the target site or the metabolic detoxification of the fungicide by the fungus. The type of resistance agent depends on the mode of action of the fungicide, such as demethylation inhibitors (DMI), quinone outside inhibitors (QoI), or multisite inhibitors (MSI). The level of resistance can vary from low to high, depending on the frequency and intensity of fungicide use, the genetic diversity and fitness of the fungus, and the environmental conditions1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is by using a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that can detect the DNA of the fungus from infected plant samples. The LAMP assay is based on the amplification of specific regions of the fungal genome using a set of primers and a polymerase enzyme under isothermal conditions. The LAMP assay can be performed in a simple device such as a water bath or a heat block, and can produce results within an hour. The LAMP assay can be combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) that can visualize the amplified DNA by using gold nanoparticles conjugated with probes3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is by producing effectors that can manipulate the host plant's defense responses and facilitate the infection process. The effectors are secreted by the fungus into the plant cells through specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the cell wall. The effectors can target different components of the plant's immune system, such as receptors, signaling pathways, transcription factors, or metabolic enzymes. The type and number of effectors produced by the fungus are not well known, but some examples are Cercospora nicotianae toxin (CNT), which induces necrosis and chlorosis in tobacco leaves, and Cercospora zeae-maydis toxin (CZT), which inhibits photosynthesis and causes gray leaf spot in maize. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the specificity and compatibility of the effectors with the host plant's genotype and phenotype. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are not well understood, but some studies have suggested that some genes involved in plant defense, cell wall biosynthesis, photosynthesis, or stress response may be important for conferring resistance or susceptibility to leaf spot diseases .
