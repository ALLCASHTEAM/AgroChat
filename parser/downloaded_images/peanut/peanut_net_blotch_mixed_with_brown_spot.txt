Peanut is a type of cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1. Peanut net blotch mixed with brown spot is a type of fungal disease that is caused by two distinct, but closely related, fungal plant pathogens: Cercospora arachidicola (early leaf spot) and Cercosporidium personatum (late leaf spot)1.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungi of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced on the surface of the leaf spots1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by weather conditions, cropping history, and varietal resistance. The disease is more severe where peanuts are grown in the same field in consecutive years, and when periods of wet weather from rain, dew or high humidity are frequent2. The conidia are dispersed by wind and rain splash to other leaves or plants1.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental factors and the pathogen strain. Symptoms of both early and late leaf spot usually appear between 30 to 50 days after planting1. However, late leaf spot often occurs later in the growing season and is generally more aggressive and difficult to control than early leaf spot1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm temperatures (between 20В°C and 30В°C), high humidity (above 90%), and long periods of leaf wetness (more than 12 hours)1. The disease is also favored by poor soil fertility, low soil pH, and high plant density1.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris or on volunteer plants in the soil1. The conidia can also survive on seed coats and infect the seedlings after germination1.
Cultural practices Cultural practices involve rotating peanuts with other crops, managing peanut residue by tillage, avoiding early sowing, and applying adequate potassium fertilizer1 2.
Genetic resistance Genetic resistanceinvolves selecting varieties that have tolerance or resistance to the leaf spot pathogens1. Fungicide application involves using seed dressings and foliar sprays that have preventive and curative properties against the fungal pathogens1 2 3.
fungicide application Fungicides should be applied according to the label instructions and the resistance management strategies2 4.
The incidence and spread of peanut web blotch mixed with brown spot disease can be effectively controlled through good field management, appropriate variety selection, seed disinfection, proper irrigation and fertilizer management, and pesticide control when necessary.
["This disease are brown or black spots on the upper leaf surface that enlarge to become circular spots with a distinct yellow border or halo (early leaf spot) or lack a yellow halo (late leaf spot)1.", "The spots can reach a size of about one-fourth of an inch in diameter1.", "The spots are also clearly defined on the lower leaf surface, where they are usually brown (early leaf spot) or dark brown to black (late leaf spot)1.", "The spots can coalesce and cause blotch symptoms on the leaves1.", "The infection also causes hormonal changes in the leaf that lead to leaf drop or defoliation1.", "Defoliation reduces healthy leaf area and weakens the stems and pegs causing pods to fall off the vine during digging and harvest1."]
["This disease are the reproductive structures of the fungal pathogens that can be seen on the surface of the leaf spots.", "These structures are called conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind and rain splash to other leaves or plants1.", "The conidia are usually dark brown to black in color and have a cylindrical shape with rounded ends1.", "They can be observed under a microscope or a hand lens1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some reports suggest that the fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as benzimidazoles and triazoles1 2. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the target genes or enzymes that reduce the sensitivity or affinity to the fungicides2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal strain, the fungicide dose, and the environmental conditions2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a molecular technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which can detect the DNA of the fungus from infected plant tissues within an hour3. The LAMP method is simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific, and can be performed in a field setting with minimal equipment3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but some studies have suggested that the fungus can produce some pathogenic effectors that can modulate the plant defense responses and facilitate the infection process4 5. Some of these effectors may belong to the necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like (NEP1-like) protein family, which can induce cell death and chlorosis in plant cells4 5. The fungus may also secrete some enzymes that can degrade the plant cell wall and allow the fungal hyphae to penetrate and colonize the plant tissues4 5. The infestation of different plants may depend on the compatibility or susceptibility of the plant genotypes to the fungal strains4 5. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are not well identified, but some studies have suggested that some genes involved in plant immunity or stress responses may play a role in conferring resistance or susceptibility to the disease . For example, some genes encoding nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins, which are key components of plant immune signaling, may be associated with web blotch resistance in peanut. Some genes encoding transcription factors, such as WRKY and MYB, which regulate various plant defense pathways, may also be involved in web blotch resistance or susceptibility in peanut.
