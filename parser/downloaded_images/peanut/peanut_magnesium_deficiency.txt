Peanut is a type of legume that is grown as a cash crop for its edible seeds1 2. Peanut magnesium deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogen, but a physiological disorder that affects the plant's metabolism and makes it more susceptible to leafspot3.
Since peanut magnesium deficiency is not a disease, it does not have a pathogenic fungus or a mode of reproduction. Since peanut magnesium deficiency is not a disease, it does not have an epidemiological pattern or a mode of transmission. However, it can be influenced by factors such as soil pH, fertilizer application, and irrigation3.
The period of disease onset for peanut magnesium deficiency is not well defined, but it may occur at any stage of plant growth. Symptoms include yellowing of older leaves, interveinal chlorosis, necrotic spots, and premature defoliation3. The environmental conditions required for peanut magnesium deficiency are low levels of magnesium in the soil or in the plant tissue. Magnesium deficiency can be induced by high levels of calcium, potassium, or ammonium in the soil, or by excessive rainfall or drought3.
Since peanut magnesium deficiency is not a disease, it does not have an overwintering method.
Applying chemical fertilizers such as dolomite or 0.5% magnesium sulfate; applying organic fertilizers, phosphorus fertilizers, and nitrate nitrogen fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate can help improve the effectiveness of magnesium fertilizers.

In acidic, magnesium-deficient soils, apply chemical fertilizers such as dolomite or magnesium sulfate.

["Since peanut magnesium deficiency is not a disease, it does not have disease signs that indicate the presence of a pathogen. However, a simple way to diagnose magnesium deficiency is to measure the magnesium concentration in the plant tissue or soil1."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of peanut magnesium deficiency is Mycosphaerella arachidicola1. This fungus causes leafspot on peanut leaves that are low in magnesium1. The mechanism of resistance of this fungus is not well understood, but it may be related to the production of melanin and cell wall degrading enzymes2. The type of resistance agent is not clear, but some studies have suggested that fungicides such as azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin can reduce the severity of leafspot2. The level of resistance of this fungus may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the peanut cultivar2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of peanut magnesium deficiency is not available, as far as I know. However, some studies have used molecular techniques such as PCR and DNA sequencing to identify and characterize the bacteria associated with peanut diseases2. Some of the bacteria that have been reported to cause diseases in peanut are Pseudomonas syringae, Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomonas campestris, and Burkholderia glumae2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of peanut magnesium deficiency is not well studied, but it may involve the interaction of the pathogens with the host plant's immune system and metabolism2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may differ depending on the pathogen species and strain2. For example, Pseudomonas syringae produces a toxin called syringomycin that inhibits the plant's defense response2. Ralstonia solanacearum secretes a protein called popA that suppresses the plant's cell death pathway2. Xanthomonas campestris injects a protein called AvrBs2 that triggers the plant's hypersensitive response2. Burkholderia glumae produces a toxin called toxoflavin that damages the plant's DNA and membranes2. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the plant's genetic resistance and susceptibility to the pathogens2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of peanut magnesium deficiency are not well known, but some studies have suggested that some genes may be involved in the plant's response to bacterial infection2. For example, a gene called AhWRKY70 has been shown to enhance the plant's resistance to Pseudomonas syringae by regulating the expression of defense-related genes2. A gene called AhNPR1 has been shown to mediate the plant's systemic acquired resistance to various pathogens by activating salicylic acid signaling2. A gene called AhDREB1A has been shown to improve the plant's tolerance to drought and salt stress, which may also affect its susceptibility to pathogens2.
