Peanut is a type of cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1 2. Peanut black spot and net blotch are both fungal diseases that affect the leaves and stems of peanut plants3 4. The causal agents are Phoma arachidicola and Pyrenophora personata, respectively5 6.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungi of these diseases is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain5 6 The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of these diseases are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop management practices7 4. Both diseases are airborne and can infect peanut plants through wounds or natural openings5 6.
The period of disease onset for these diseases varies depending on the climatic conditions and the susceptibility of the peanut cultivars3 4. Generally, peanut black spot can occur at any stage of crop development, but is more severe during pod filling5. Net blotch can appear as early as 30 days after planting, but is more common during flowering and podding stages6. The environmental conditions required for these diseases are different for each pathogen. Peanut black spot prefers cool and moist conditions, with optimal temperatures ranging from 15 to 25В°C and relative humidity above 80%5. Net blotch favors warm and humid conditions, with optimal temperatures ranging from 20 to 30В°C and relative humidity above 90%6. Both diseases also require frequent rainfall or irrigation for infection and sporulation5 6.
The overwintering method of these diseases is by surviving on infected plant debris or seeds that serve as inoculum sources for the next season5 6. The fungi can also persist in the soil for several years5 6.
Chemical control involves applying fungicides that are effective against both pathogens, such as diniconazole, carbendazol, chlorothalonil, and tebuconazole1 2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the disease severity, weather conditions, and peanut cultivar1 2. The control effect of chemical control can be enhanced by combining it with other measures1 2.
Physical measures include cutting off the infected parts and destroying them by burning or burying1.
Biological control involves using antagonistic microorganisms or plant extracts that can inhibit the growth or spore production of the pathogens1.
Agricultural control includes crop rotation, early planting, resistant cultivars, proper spacing, weed management, and irrigation management1 2.
["These diseases are changes in color, shape or function of the plant parts affected by the pathogens.", "Peanut black spot causes brown to black spots on the leaves and stems that may have yellow halos1 2.", "The spots can coalesce and cause premature defoliation and reduced pod yield1 2.", "Net blotch causes brown to black spots on the leaves and stems that may have yellow halos1 2. The spots can enlarge and form irregular patches that reduce photosynthesis and transpiration1 2.", "Both diseases can also affect the pegs and pods and cause reduced quality and quantity of seeds1 2."]
["These diseases are the physical evidence of the pathogen itself on the plant.", "Peanut black spot produces masses of dark spores on the lower surface of the leaf spots that give them a velvety appearance1 2.", "Net blotch produces tufts of silvery spores on the upper surface of the leaf spots that can be seen with a magnifying glass1 2.", "Both diseases can also produce spores on the stem lesions1 2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungi of these diseases is the ability to overcome the host defense mechanisms and/or the fungicide applications. The mechanism of resistance may involve genetic mutations, gene expression changes, or metabolic adaptations that affect the pathogenicity, virulence, or detoxification of the fungi1 2. The type of resistance agent may be a host resistance gene, a fungicide molecule, or a biological antagonist1 2. The level of resistance may vary from partial to complete, depending on the degree of compatibility between the host and the pathogen, or the efficacy and frequency of the fungicide1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungi of these diseases is to use molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect and identify the specific DNA sequences of the fungi from infected plant samples3 4. These methods are rapid, sensitive, and specific, and can be performed in a laboratory or in the field3 4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of these diseases is the process by which the fungi invade and colonize the host tissues and cause disease symptoms. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are molecules secreted by the fungi that interact with the host cells and modulate their functions, such as cell wall degradation, signal transduction, defense response, or cell death . The differences in infestation of different plants are determined by the compatibility between the fungal effectors and the host receptors, which can trigger either susceptibility or resistance . 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungi of these diseases are the host genes or proteins that are essential for plant growth, development, or defense, and that can be manipulated by the fungal effectors to favor infection . For example, knockout lethal genes are genes that cause plant death when mutated or silenced. These genes may be involved in regulating cell cycle, DNA repair, stress response, or hormone signaling. If these genes are targeted by the fungal effectors, they may compromise the plant's ability to survive or resist infection.
