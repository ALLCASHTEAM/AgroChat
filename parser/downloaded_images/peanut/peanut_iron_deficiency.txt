Iron deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogen, but a physiological disorder that occurs when the plant cannot absorb enough iron from the soil1. Not applicable, as iron deficiency is not caused by a pathogenic fungus.
Not applicable, as iron deficiency is not transmitted by any agent, but depends on the soil conditions and plant factors1. The period of disease onset for iron deficiency varies depending on the soil type, pH, moisture, temperature, and cultivar. Generally, iron deficiency symptoms appear in the early stages of plant growth, especially during periods of rapid growth or stress2.
The environmental conditions required for iron deficiency are calcareous and alkaline soils with high pH, low organic matter, high phosphorus, high bicarbonate, and low iron availability3 4. Iron deficiency can also be induced by drought, flooding, cold temperatures, or root damage1. Not applicable, as iron deficiency does not overwinter in the soil or plant tissues.

В·Before sowing, soak the seeds in a 0.1% ferrous sulfate solution for 12 hours1.В·At the time of base fertilizer, apply 2.5~3 kg of ferrous sulfate per mu, preferably mixed with organic fertilizer or calcium superphosphate2.В·At the flowering or pod-setting stage, spray 30~50 kg of 0.3%~0.5% ferrous sulfate solution per mu on the leaves, once every 5~6 days, for a total of 2~3 times . To increase the adhesion, add 0.1% of neutral detergent to the solution3.
В·Choose plots with acidic soil to grow peanuts, or apply amendments such as lime or ammonium sulfate to alkaline soil, to lower the soil pH and increase the solubility of iron1.В·Plow the soil deeply, and turn the iron ions in the surface soil to the bottom layer, to reduce the combination with hydroxide ions and phosphate ions, and increase the availability of iron4.В·Rotate with non-host crops, avoid continuous cropping of peanuts, reduce the consumption of iron in the soil, and increase the organic matter content in the soil .В·Apply fertilizer reasonably, avoid excessive use of alkaline fertilizer and phosphorus fertilizer, which may affect the absorption and utilization of iron .
В·Inoculate peanut seeds with rhizobia before sowing, to increase the nitrogen fixation ability of peanut roots, and improve the plantвЂ™s utilization of iron5.В·Inoculate soil with iron bacteria or sulfur oxidizing bacteria before or after sowing, to increase the availability of iron in the soil, lower the soil pH, and facilitate the absorption of iron by peanuts.В·During the growth period of peanuts, apply organic fertilizer or bio-fertilizer containing iron bacteria or sulfur oxidizing bacteria to the peanut roots, to provide available iron sources, and improve the nutritional status of peanuts.
В·Before or after sowing, apply or concentrate 2.5-3.0 kg of ferrous sulfate (black alum) per mu, preferably mixed with organic fertilizer or calcium superphosphate1.В·Before sowing, soak the seeds in 0.1% ferrous sulfate solution for 12 hours.В·After the peanuts start to flower, spray 30-50 kg of 0.3-0.5% ferrous sulfate solution per mu on the leaves, and add 0.1% of neutral detergent to increase the adhesion and improve the spraying effect.
["Iron deficiency in peanut plants are chlorosis, or yellowing, of the young leaves, especially along the veins.", "The chlorosis can spread to the whole plant and cause growth retardation and reduced yield6."]
["There are no disease signs of iron deficiency in peanut plants, as it is not caused by a pathogen, but by a lack of iron in the soil or plant tissues."]

A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of peanut iron deficiency is to use a PCR-based assay that can detect and identify specific bacterial strains based on their DNA sequences. For example, a study by Zhang et al. 1 developed a PCR assay that can differentiate Ralstonia solanacearum strains that cause bacterial wilt in peanut from other strains based on a unique DNA fragment. This method can be used to diagnose bacterial wilt in peanut plants and soil samples within 24 hours 1. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of peanut iron deficiency involves the production and secretion of siderophores by the bacteria, which are organic molecules that can chelate and solubilize iron from the soil or plant tissues. The bacteria then use the siderophores to acquire iron for their growth and metabolism 2. Some examples of phytopathogenic bacteria that produce siderophores are Pseudomonas syringae, Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomonas campestris, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens 2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the bacterial species and strain, but they generally include toxins, enzymes, polysaccharides, and proteins that can interfere with plant defense or induce disease symptoms 3. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the host specificity and compatibility of the bacteria, which are determined by factors such as plant genotype, bacterial genotype, environmental conditions, and plant-bacteria interactions 3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of peanut iron deficiency are genes or proteins that are involved in iron homeostasis, transport, or utilization in the plant. For example, a study by Liu et al. identified several genes that are differentially expressed in peanut under iron deficiency stress, such as ferritin, metallothionein, nicotianamine synthase, and iron-regulated transporter. These genes may be involved in iron storage, detoxification, mobilization, or uptake in peanut. Knockout or mutation of these genes may affect the plant's ability to cope with iron deficiency or resist bacterial infection.
