Peanut is a type of cash crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1 2. Peanut rust disease is a fungal disease that is caused by the basidiomycete fungus Puccinia arachidis Speg.1 2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by urediniospores and teliospores1 2. Urediniospores are asexual spores that are produced in orange pustules on the lower surface of the leaves3 4. Teliospores are sexual spores that are rarely observed in this fungus1 2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, and leaf wetness5 2. The disease is mainly airborne, as the urediniospores are dispersed by wind to new host plants3 4. The disease can also be transmitted by infected seeds or plant debris1 2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the peanut cultivar1 2. The disease can appear as early as 30 days after planting or as late as 90 days before harvest3 4. The disease can progress rapidly and cause severe defoliation and yield loss if not controlled3 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature, high humidity, and frequent rainfall1 2. The optimal temperature range for infection and sporulation is between 20В°C and 30В°C1 2. The relative humidity should be above 80% for infection and above 90% for sporulation1 2. The leaf wetness duration should be at least 6 hours for infection and at least 12 hours for sporulation1 2.
The overwintering method of this disease is not well understood, but it is believed that the fungus does not survive in cold climates and relies on alternative hosts, such as wild legumes, or infected seeds or plant debris to survive between seasons1 2.
Fungicides such as azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, chlorothalonil and tebuconazole have activity against peanut rust and can be applied at recommended rates and intervals1 2. However, fungicides should be applied before the disease becomes severe, as they will only slow down the spread and not eliminate the disease1. The pre-harvest interval of the fungicides should also be considered1.
Removing infected plant parts may help reduce inoculum sources, but it is not practical or effective for large-scale production3.
There is no known biological control agent for peanut rust disease3.
Crop rotation, resistant varieties, planting date, row spacing and irrigation management can help reduce the risk of peanut rust disease2 3. Crop rotation with non-host crops can reduce the survival of the fungus in the soil2. Resistant varieties can reduce the severity and spread of the disease3. Planting date can avoid periods of favorable weather conditions for the disease2. Row spacing can affect the microclimate and canopy humidity that influence the disease development3. Irrigation management can avoid excessive soil moisture and leaf wetness that favor the disease2.
["Orange to reddish brown pustules on the lower leaf surface, usually surrounded by a yellow halo4 1 2 3.", "Premature defoliation and reduced pod yield and quality4 1 2 3.", "Reduced photosynthesis and translocation of assimilates to pods3."]
["Urediniospores: These are orange to reddish brown spores that form pustules on the lower leaf surface. They are oval to ellipsoidal in shape and have thick walls with echinulate ornamentation3 5.", "Teliospores: These are dark brown to black spores that are rarely formed on peanut leaves. They are two-celled and have thick walls with smooth ornamentation3 5."]
Mechanism of resistance: Peanut rust resistance is partial and rate reducing, where several polygenic minor genes, the components of resistance, provide varying levels of partial resistance, leading to a reduced rate of the disease epidemic1. The resistance genes may act by delaying the infection process, reducing the number and size of lesions, and limiting the sporulation of the fungus2. Type of resistance agent: Resistance genes (R genes) are located in the peanut genome and encode for proteins that recognize specific avirulence genes (AVR genes) in the fungus and trigger defense responses2 3. Level of resistance: The level of resistance varies among peanut genotypes and depends on the genetic background, environmental conditions, and pathogen variability1 2. No complete resistance to peanut rust has been reported in cultivated peanut, but high resistance has been identified in some wild Arachis species2 4. 
I do not have information on a quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of peanut rust disease. However, some possible methods that could be used are molecular detection using PCR or LAMP, serological detection using ELISA or immunostrips, or morphological identification using microscopy or spore traps. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: Pathogenic effectors are molecules secreted by the fungus that manipulate host cell processes and facilitate infection. The type and number of pathogenic effectors of peanut rust fungus are not well known, but some studies have identified candidate effectors using transcriptomics and proteomics approaches3 . For example, one study identified 16 candidate effectors that were upregulated during infection and showed homology to known fungal effectors3. Differences in infestation of different plants: The infestation of different plants by peanut rust fungus depends on the compatibility between the R genes in the plant and the AVR genes in the fungus. If there is a matching pair of R-AVR genes, the plant will recognize the fungus and mount a defense response, resulting in a resistant reaction. If there is no matching pair of R-AVR genes, the plant will not recognize the fungus and allow infection, resulting in a susceptible reaction2 3. 
Knockout lethal genes: Knockout lethal genes are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of an organism. If these genes are disrupted or deleted, the organism will die or be severely impaired. Knockout lethal genes could be potential targets for developing novel fungicides or genetic engineering strategies to control peanut rust disease. However, I do not have information on specific knockout lethal genes for peanut rust fungus.
