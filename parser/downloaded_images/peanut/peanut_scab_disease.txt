The type of crop of this plant is a cash crop. Peanuts are grown for their edible seeds and oil, and are exported to many countries. 1 2 The type of disease of this disease is a fungal disease. The causal pathogen of this disease is Sphaceloma arachidis, which is the anamorphic stage of ElsinoГѓВ« arachidis. 1 3
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia and microconidia. Both of these spores are stored in acervuli, which are asexual fruiting bodies that have a pad or mat-like shape and are formed below the epidermal tissue of the host. 1 The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are polycyclic and windborne. The spores overwinter in infected debris, and serve as a source of inoculum for the next growing season. A second source of inoculum is also spread during the growing season by wind. 1
The period of disease onset for this disease is after flowering. The disease can infect leaves, stem, root, and fruit pods of peanut, and cause damage to the production and quality of peanut. 2 3 The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid. The disease is normally found in warm areas where peanuts are grown, such as Brazil, Argentina, United States, and Africa. The optimal temperature for infection is 25Г‚В°C to 30Г‚В°C, and the optimal relative humidity is above 80%. 2 3
The overwintering method of this disease is by infected debris. The spores survive in the infected plant residues that remain on the soil surface or are buried in the soil. 1
Fungicides such as mancozeb, chlorothalonil, and copper oxychloride can be applied to reduce disease severity. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the disease level and environmental conditions. The control effect can vary from 50% to 90%. 1 2
Cutting off the infected parts of the plant and removing them from the field can reduce the inoculum source and disease spread. 2
There is no effective biological control agent reported for this disease so far. 2
Planting resistant or tolerant cultivars, rotating with non-host crops, avoiding monoculture, and practicing good sanitation can help prevent or manage this disease. 1 2
["Lesions or scabs on the leaves, petioles, stems, roots, and pods of peanut. The lesions are initially small, circular, and light brown, and later become larger, irregular, and dark brown or black. The lesions can coalesce and cover large areas of the plant tissue. 1 2", "Necrosis and hyperplasia of the infected tissue. The necrotic tissue becomes dry and brittle, and the hyperplastic tissue becomes thickened and distorted. The infected pods may crack open and expose the seeds to infection. 1 2", "Reduced growth and yield of peanut plants. The disease can cause significant losses in peanut production and quality, especially when infection occurs early in the season or during pod formation. 1 2"]
["Acervuli of the fungus on the surface of the infected tissue. The acervuli are small, black, cushion-like structures that contain conidia and microconidia of the fungus. The acervuli can be seen with a hand lens or a microscope. 1", "Conidia and microconidia of the fungus in the air or on the plant surface. The conidia are subglobose, hyaline, one-celled, 3.8 to 6.3 by 3.2 to 6.0 ГЋВјm, and the microconidia are short, oblong, hyaline, one-celled, 5.9 to 7.3 by 2.8 to 4.4 ГЋВјm. The spores are dispersed by wind or rain splash and can infect new hosts or re-infect the same host. 1"]
The mechanism of resistance: The fungus may have mutations or alterations in the target site or metabolic pathway of the fungicide, or may have enhanced detoxification or efflux of the fungicide. 1 The type of resistance agent: The fungus may develop resistance to different classes of fungicides, such as benzimidazoles, demethylation inhibitors (DMIs), quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), or succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs). 1 The level of resistance: The fungus may exhibit different levels of resistance depending on the fungicide dose, frequency, and mode of action. Resistance may be qualitative (complete or none) or quantitative (partial or reduced). 1 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is by using a molecular diagnostic tool such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). These methods can detect the presence and identity of the fungus based on its DNA or RNA sequences. 2 3 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus may produce various molecules that can manipulate the host defense response, such as enzymes, toxins, elicitors, or suppressors. The number and diversity of these effectors may determine the virulence and host range of the fungus. 4 The differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus may have different levels of compatibility with different host plants, depending on the interaction between the fungal effectors and the host receptors or resistance genes. Some plants may be more susceptible or resistant to the fungus than others. 4 
Knockout lethal genes: These are genes that are essential for fungal survival or viability, and their disruption or deletion would result in fungal death or severe defects. Examples of such genes are those involved in DNA replication, transcription, translation, cell wall biosynthesis, or metabolism. Knockout reduced virulence genes: These are genes that are not essential for fungal survival or viability, but their disruption or deletion would result in reduced fungal virulence or aggressiveness on the host plant. Examples of such genes are those involved in spore formation, germination, penetration, colonization, toxin production, or effector secretion.
