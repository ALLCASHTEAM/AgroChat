Peanut is a type of legume crop that is grown for its edible seeds1. It can be classified as a cash crop because it is sold for profit and not mainly for subsistence2. Peanut powdery mildew is a type of fungal disease caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Erysiphe pisi3. Other fungi such as Erysiphe trifolii and Erysiphe baeumleri have also been reported causing this disease on pea3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or insects4. The conidia germinate on the leaf surface and penetrate the epidermal cells to form haustoria, which are specialized feeding structures. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, light, and plant density5. The disease is more severe in warm (15-27В°C), dry, and shady conditions with high relative humidity6 7. The disease is transmitted by airborne conidia that land on susceptible host plants3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the growth stage of the host plant and the environmental conditions. The disease can occur at any stage of plant development, but it is more common and damaging in late sowings or in late maturing varieties3. The disease can appear as early as 10 days after sowing or as late as 60 days before harvest. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm (15-27В°C), dry, and shady conditions with high relative humidity6 7. The disease is favored by poor air circulation, dense plant canopy, and high nitrogen fertilization6 7. The disease is also influenced by soil conditions such as pH, moisture, and organic matter content.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving as mycelium or cleistothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) on infected plant debris or alternative hosts such as weeds or legumes . The cleistothecia can produce ascospores that can initiate new infections in the next season.
Fungicides such as triadimefon, propiconazole, tebuconazole, azoxystrobin, and pyraclostrobin can be applied to control powdery mildew on peanut . The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect can vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance level of the host plant .
Removing and destroying infected plant debris or alternative hosts can reduce the inoculum source of the disease1 2. Snipping infected lower leaves can also reduce the spreading of mildew3.
Some antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Trichoderma harzianum, and Ampelomyces quisqualis can inhibit the growth and sporulation of the pathogen . These biocontrol agents can be applied as foliar sprays or seed treatments .
Planting resistant or tolerant varieties, avoiding late sowings or late maturing varieties, improving air circulation and light penetration by proper spacing and pruning, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, and irrigating in the morning to reduce humidity are some of the cultural practices that can prevent or reduce powdery mildew on peanut1 2 4.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is mainly related to the fungicide resistance. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the target genes or enzymes, overexpression of efflux pumps, modification of membrane permeability, or detoxification of fungicides . The type of resistance agent depends on the mode of action of the fungicide. For example, resistance to demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) such as triadimefon is caused by mutations in the CYP51 gene encoding sterol 14О±-demethylase . Resistance to quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) such as azoxystrobin is caused by mutations in the cytochrome b gene encoding the Qo subunit of mitochondrial complex III . Resistance to succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) such as boscalid is caused by mutations in the SDHC or SDHD genes encoding subunits of succinate dehydrogenase . The level of resistance can be measured by the effective concentration (EC) or effective dose (ED) of the fungicide that inhibits 50% or 90% of the fungal growth or spore germination (EC50, EC90, ED50, ED90) . The level of resistance can also be classified as low, moderate, high, or very high based on the resistance factor (RF), which is the ratio of EC50 or ED50 values between resistant and sensitive isolates . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is by using molecular markers such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) . These methods can detect and identify the fungal DNA from infected plant samples within hours. PCR requires a thermal cycler and specific primers to amplify the target DNA sequence, while LAMP requires a constant temperature and four or six primers to amplify the target DNA sequence with high specificity and sensitivity . Both methods can be combined with fluorescence detection or gel electrophoresis to visualize the amplified products . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is by producing and secreting effectors that manipulate host immunity and metabolism . The type and number of effectors vary depending on the fungal species and strain. For example, Erysiphe pisi has been reported to secrete at least 248 candidate effectors, including 16 cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs), 11 necrosis-inducing proteins (NIPs), and 10 secreted lipases . The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility or incompatibility between the fungal effectors and the host receptors or resistance genes. For example, Erysiphe pisi can infect pea plants that lack er1 , er2 , or Er3 genes, but not those that have these genes. The er1 gene encodes a receptor-like kinase that recognizes an unknown fungal effector and triggers a hypersensitive response (HR) . The er2 gene encodes a MLO protein that is required for fungal penetration and colonization . The Er3 gene encodes a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein that recognizes an avirulence effector AvrPis3 and activates HR . 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are mainly related to host defense responses or metabolic pathways that are essential for plant survival or growth. For example, knockout lethal genes such as RBOH , NPR1 , PAD4 , EDS1 , SGT1 , HSP90 , RAR1 , NDR1 , COI1 , JAR1 , AOC , LOX2 , AOS , OPR3 , PDF1.2 , PR1 , PR2 , PR5 , BAK1 , BKK1 , FLS2 , EFR , CERK1 , LYK5 , BIK1 , RIPK , MAPKKK5 , MAPKK4/5 , MPK3/6 , WRKY22/29/33/53/70 have been shown to be involved in plant immunity against powdery mildew fungi . These genes encode various components of signaling pathways such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis and signaling, jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signaling, ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and signaling, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), receptor-like kinases (RLKs), receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs), mitogen-activated
