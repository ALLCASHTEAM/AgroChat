Peanut is a type of oilseed crop1 that can be classified as a cash crop1 2 because it is grown for its edible seeds and oil that have high economic value1. Peanut scorch disease is caused by a fungus called Leptosphaerulina arachidicola3 2 that can cause two types of symptoms: pepper spot and leaf scorch spot2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing conidia3, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop rotation4. The disease is more severe in regions with high humidity and rainfall, and in fields with continuous peanut cultivation5. The fungus can survive in infected plant debris or soil, and infect new plants through wounds or natural openings5. The disease is mainly airborne but can also be seedborne5.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the type of symptom. Pepper spot can occur at any stage of plant growth, but is more common during early vegetative growth5. Leaf scorch spot usually appears during late vegetative or reproductive growth, and can cause premature defoliation and reduced yield5 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30В°C), high humidity (&gt;90%), and frequent rainfall (&gt;50 mm/month)5. These conditions favor the germination of conidia and the infection of leaves5.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in infected plant debris or soil5. The fungus can persist for several months in these substrates, and can be carried over to the next season by wind, rain, or contaminated seeds5.
Chemical control involves applying fungicides at regular intervals to prevent or reduce the infection of leaves1 2. Some of the fungicides that are effective against peanut scorch disease are chlorothalonil, propiconazole, tebuconazole, and azoxystrobin1 2. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the fungicide label, weather conditions, and disease severity1 2. The control effect of fungicides can vary depending on the resistance of the fungus and the timing of application1 2.
Cultural control involves rotating peanut with other crops that are not hosts for the fungus, such as corn, cotton, or soybean1 3. This can reduce the overwintering population of the fungus in the soil and make chemical control more effective and profitable1 3.
Biological control involves using antagonistic microorganisms or plant extracts to inhibit the growth or infection of the fungus4. For example, some studies have reported that Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, and neem oil can suppress peanut scorch disease under laboratory or greenhouse conditions4. However, more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of biological control under field conditions4.

["This disease are pepper spot and leaf scorch spot5 3.", "Pepper spot is characterized by small (1-2 mm), circular, dark brown to black lesions on both surfaces of the leaves5 3. Leaf scorch spot is characterized by larger (3-10 mm), irregular, brown to tan lesions with dark brown margins on both surfaces of the leaves5 3.", "Both types of lesions can coalesce and cause extensive necrosis and defoliation of the leaves5 3."]
["This disease are the presence of conidia and conidiophores of the fungus on the lesions5 3.", "Conidia are oval to cylindrical, hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, one-celled or septate spores that are produced in chains at the tips of conidiophores5 3.", "Conidiophores are erect, branched, septate, hyaline to pale brown hyphae that emerge from the stomata or wounds on the lesions5 3.", "The conidia and conidiophores can be observed under a microscope or a hand lens after moistening the infected leaves with water5 3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some studies have reported that the fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as benzimidazoles and strobilurins1 2. The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations in the target genes or enzymes of the fungicides, such as ГЋВІ-tubulin or cytochrome b1 2. The type of resistance agent may depend on the mode of action and specificity of the fungicide1 2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal strain, fungicide dose, and environmental conditions1 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is by using a molecular technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)3. This technique can detect the DNA of the fungus from infected leaves or seeds in less than an hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment or reagents3. The LAMP method can also differentiate between Leptosphaerulina arachidicola and Leptosphaerulina crassiasca, two closely related fungi that cause peanut scorch disease3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but some studies have suggested that the fungus can produce various pathogenic effectors that modulate the host defense response and facilitate infection1 2. For example, some effectors may suppress plant immunity by interfering with signaling pathways or inducing cell death1 2. Some effectors may also enhance fungal virulence by degrading plant cell walls or detoxifying plant metabolites. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain and the host plant. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the compatibility or resistance of the plant to the fungus. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are not well known, but some studies have identified some genes that are involved in the fungal pathogenicity or the plant defense response. For example, some genes that encode enzymes for fungal metabolism, cell wall synthesis, or stress response may be essential for fungal survival or virulence. Some genes that encode receptors, transcription factors, or signaling molecules may be important for plant recognition or resistance to the fungus. Knocking out these genes may affect the interaction between the fungus and the plant.
