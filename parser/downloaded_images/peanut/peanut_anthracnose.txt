Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important cash crop and oil crop around the world1. Anthracnose is a fungal disease that affects many plant species, including peanuts2. The fungi that cause anthracnose on peanuts belong to the genus Colletotrichum1 3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are single-celled, cylindrical and colorless spores1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind. The disease spreads by airborne or watersplashed conidia that infect young leaves and stems2 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the climatic conditions and the susceptibility of the peanut cultivars. Generally, the disease appears in the late season, especially after flowering3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool and wet weather, with temperatures between 50 and 55 degrees F and high relative humidity (\&gt; 85% RH)2 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in infected plant debris or seeds that serve as sources of inoculum for the next season2 3.
Applying fungicides such as azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, flutriafol, mancozeb, or propiconazole can reduce the disease severity and increase the yield1 2. The type of agent, application dose, application period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease situation. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the pathogen1.
Removing and destroying infected plant debris or seeds can reduce the inoculum sources for the next season3 4. Cutting off the infected parts of the plant can also prevent the disease from spreading to healthy tissues3.
Using antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, or Pseudomonas fluorescens can inhibit the growth and sporulation of the pathogen and induce plant resistance1 2. These biocontrol agents can be applied as seed treatments, soil amendments, or foliar sprays1.
Planting resistant cultivars, rotating crops with non-host plants, avoiding overhead irrigation, spacing plants properly, and maintaining optimal soil fertility and pH can enhance plant health and reduce disease incidence and severity3 4 2.
["This disease are brown lesions on leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits.", "The lesions may expand and coalesce, causing leaf distortion, wilting, defoliation, fruit rotting, and premature senescence3 4 5."]
["This disease are fungal fruiting structures that appear as small black dots on the lesions.", "These structures produce conidia that are dispersed by wind or water to infect new hosts3 4 5."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the genetic variation of the pathogen and the host plant. The mechanism of resistance involves the recognition of pathogen effectors by plant resistance (R) genes and the activation of defense responses1 2. The type of resistance agent can be a fungicide, a biocontrol agent, or a resistant cultivar3 4. The level of resistance can be complete or partial, depending on the degree of disease severity reduction3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is by using molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), or DNA barcoding . These methods can detect and identify the pathogen from infected plant tissues or seeds within hours . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is by penetrating the plant cuticle and cell wall with appressoria (specialized infection structures) and producing necrotrophic effectors that induce cell death and tissue maceration . The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the pathogen species and strain . The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility or incompatibility between the pathogen and the host, which is determined by the presence or absence of R genes and corresponding avirulence (Avr) genes . 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are genes that are essential for plant survival or defense, such as those involved in photosynthesis, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, or R gene-mediated resistance . Knockout lethal genes are genes that cause lethality when mutated or deleted .
