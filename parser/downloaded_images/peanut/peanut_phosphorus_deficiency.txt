Peanuts are a type of legume that is popular in the US1. They can be classified as a cash crop because they are grown for their edible seeds and oil1. Phosphorus deficiency in peanuts is not a disease caused by a pathogen, but a physiological disorder that affects the plant growth and development2 3.
Since phosphorus deficiency is not a disease, there is no pathogenic fungus involved and no mode of reproduction to consider. Phosphorus deficiency in peanuts can occur due to low soil test phosphorus value, low soil pH, dry soil conditions, cold temperatures, soil compaction, herbicide injury, insect pressure, or poor soil health4. It is not transmitted by any vector, but depends on the soil and environmental factors that affect the phosphorus availability and uptake by the plants3.
Phosphorus deficiency in peanuts can be visually identified at the early vegetative stage as an abnormally dark green or reddish purple color along the edge of the lower plant leaves3. The symptoms may diminish as the soil warms up or after phosphorus fertilization3. The environmental conditions required for phosphorus deficiency in peanuts are low soil test phosphorus value, low soil pH (pH &lt; 5), dry soil conditions, cold temperatures (especially in early spring), soil compaction, herbicide injury, insect pressure, or poor soil health3. These factors reduce the phosphorus availability and uptake by the plants3.
Phosphorus deficiency in peanuts does not have an overwintering method because it is not a disease. However, phosphorus fertilization can help prevent or correct phosphorus deficiency in peanuts by increasing the soil phosphorus level and enhancing the plant growth and yield2 5.
Chemical control involves applying phosphorus fertilizer to the soil or spraying calcium superphosphate solution to the plants1.


Agricultural control involves selecting phosphorus-efficient peanut varieties, improving soil pH, enhancing soil organic matter, avoiding soil compaction, and reducing pest and weed pressure2 3.
["Phosphorus deficiency in peanuts are slow growth, short plants, few branches, poorly developed roots, dark green or reddish purple color along the edge of the lower plant leaves, reduced flower bud differentiation, small pods, deformed fruit, and late maturity1 3."]
["Phosphorus deficiency in peanuts does not have any disease signs because it is not caused by a pathogen. However, soil testing can be used to determine the phosphorus level and availability in the soil3."]
some studies have reported that phosphorus deficiency can increase the susceptibility of peanuts to fungal diseases such as early leaf spot, late leaf spot, and stem rot1 2. Phosphorus deficiency can also affect the plant's defense mechanisms, such as phenolic compounds and antioxidant enzymes2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of phosphorus deficiency in peanuts is to use a rapid diagnostic kit that can detect the presence of Ralstonia solanacearum, the causal agent of bacterial wilt. This kit uses a lateral flow immunoassay that can provide results within 10 minutes. The kit is sensitive, specific, and easy to use in the field. 
Phosphorus deficiency can impair the root system and reduce the uptake of water and nutrients, making the plants more vulnerable to drought stress and soil-borne pathogens1 2. Phosphorus deficiency can alter the expression of genes related to plant immunity, such as pathogenesis-related proteins, chitinases, and glucanases2. Phosphorus deficiency can affect the production and secretion of root exudates, which can influence the composition and activity of soil microorganisms2. Some root exudates can act as signals or substrates for pathogenic bacteria, while others can inhibit their growth or virulence. Phosphorus deficiency can modulate the interaction between peanuts and beneficial microorganisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria, which can enhance plant growth and resistance to pathogens2 3. 
A gene called AhRRS1 confers resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum by activating defense responses and suppressing bacterial growth. A gene called AhRRS2 enhances susceptibility to Ralstonia solanacearum by suppressing defense responses and facilitating bacterial invasion. A gene called AhRRS3 regulates resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum by modulating ethylene signaling and cell wall integrity.
