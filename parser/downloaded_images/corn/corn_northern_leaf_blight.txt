Corn is a type of cash crop that is grown for its grain or forage1. Corn big spot disease is a type of fungal disease caused by the pathogen Phyllachora maydis2 3, also known as Гўв‚¬Е“tar spotГўв‚¬Вќ1.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or rain2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop residue4. The disease prefers relatively cool temperatures and high humidity to develop and spread1. The fungus survives the winter on residue from the prior corn crop, providing a primary source of inoculum2. Spores from the fungus are splashed onto the lower leaves early in the season and then carried by air currents higher into the canopy or into neighboring fields2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the weather conditions and the susceptibility of the corn hybrid2. The disease can appear at any stage of corn development, but it is more likely to cause yield loss if it infects the plants before or during tasseling and pollination2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool temperatures (below 80Г‚В°F) and high humidity (above 75%)2. The disease also favors wet weather and high amounts of crop residue on the soil surface1 2.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected corn residue that remains on the soil surface2.
Applying foliar fungicides with different modes of action, such as DelaroГ‚В® Complete fungicide or Miravis Neo fungicide, at the V4 to V8 and VT/R1 corn growth stages can help reduce disease severity and protect yield potential1 2. The fungicide application should be based on the disease risk factors, such as weather conditions, corn hybrid susceptibility, and crop residue1.
Removing or burying the infected corn residue can help reduce the inoculum source for the next season1 3.
There is no known biological control agent for this disease.
Using crop rotation with non-host crops, such as soybean, wheat, or alfalfa, can help break the disease cycle and reduce the inoculum level1 3. Selecting corn hybrids with genetic resistance or tolerance to this disease can also help minimize yield losses1 4.
["Small, circular to oval, dark brown to black spots on the leaves that resemble drops of tar5 1. The spots may coalesce and cover large areas of the leaf surface1.", "Premature senescence and death of the leaves, resulting in reduced photosynthesis and grain fill1.", "Increased susceptibility to stalk rots and lodging due to reduced stalk strength and quality1."]
["Black, raised structures called stromata that protrude from the leaf surface and contain the fungal spores1. The stromata are difficult to scrape off with a fingernail or knife blade5.", "Black, powdery spores that may be visible on the leaf surface or on a white paper when rubbed with an infected leaf1."]
A gene called Qrtsc8 has been found to confer tar spot resistance in corn, and molecular markers have been developed to quickly and efficiently identify this gene in corn germplasm1. A community of microorganisms known as the microbiome has been observed on tar-spot-resistant but not susceptible corn plants, suggesting a possible role of these microbes in enhancing plant immunity1. Several proteins called effectors have been identified that the tar spot fungus uses to manipulate the plant defenses and cause disease. These effectors could be potential targets for developing resistant varieties or detecting different strains of the fungus1. Some exotic sources of resistance to tar spot have been found in tropical corn germplasm, such as landraces from Mexico and Brazil, that could be used for breeding new resistant hybrids2.

The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary among different strains of the fungus and affect their virulence and host range1. Some effectors may suppress plant immunity, while others may induce plant defense responses1. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on their genetic resistance or susceptibility to the disease, as well as their environmental conditions and crop management practices4. Some plants may have genes or microbes that confer resistance or tolerance to the disease, while others may be more vulnerable to infection due to favorable weather conditions or high amounts of crop residue4. 
Knockout lethal genes are genes that are essential for plant survival and growth, and if they are disrupted by fungal infection, they could cause plant death or severe symptoms. Some examples of knockout lethal genes in corn are ZmRIP1 and ZmRIP2, which encode ribosome-inactivating proteins that are involved in plant defense against pathogens. These genes could be potential targets for developing resistant varieties or screening for fungal virulence. Other genes that are involved in plant immunity or stress responses could also be potential targets for the fungus, such as NPR1, which regulates systemic acquired resistance; WRKY, which encodes transcription factors that modulate defense gene expression; or HSP, which encodes heat shock proteins that protect plants from heat stress. These genes could be modulated by fungal effectors or influenced by environmental factors during infection.
