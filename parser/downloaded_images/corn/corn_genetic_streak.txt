Maize is a staple crop that is widely cultivated and consumed in many parts of the world, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America1. Maize streak disease is a viral disease that is caused by maize streak dwarf virus (MSDV), a geminivirus that is indigenous to Africa2 3. MSV belongs to the genus Mastrevirus of the family Geminiviridae and has a circular, single-stranded DNA genome that encodes four proteins3.
MSV does not have a pathogenic fungus associated with it, so there is no mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus involved. MSDV is transmitted by at least 11 leafhopper species in the genus Cicadulina, with Cicadulina mbila being the main vector2 4. The leafhoppers acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants and transmit it to healthy plants during subsequent feeding3. The virus can also be transmitted through infected seeds or vegetative propagation materials2.
The period of disease onset for maize streak disease depends on the time of infection and the environmental conditions. Generally, infection at early stages of plant growth (seedling to pre-tassel stage) results in more severe symptoms and yield losses than infection at later stages (tassel to maturity stage)2 3. The symptoms may appear within 7 to 14 days after infection under favorable conditions2. The environmental conditions required for maize streak disease are high temperature (above 25В°C) and high humidity (above 80%)2 3. These conditions favor the multiplication and movement of the virus within the plant and the activity and survival of the leafhopper vectors2 3. The disease is more prevalent in the rainy season than in the dry season2.
MSV can overwinter in alternative hosts, such as wild grasses or weeds, that serve as reservoirs for the virus and the leafhopper vectors2 3. The virus can also survive in infected seeds or planting materials, such as cuttings or suckers2.
Treat aphids and prevent diseases. In areas where dwarf mosaic disease is common, internal insecticides can be coated to control aphids after emergence. After sowing and before seedling emergence and seeding, spray with 10% imidacloprid 30g/mu+5% Junduqing 100ml/mu, which can not only kill insects, but also reduce diseases to a certain extent.
Edible compost or decomposed Manure retted by Xiaosu fungus does not need fungus bearing fertilizer. The Manure shall not contain barley disease residues, and the formula fertilization technology shall be used appropriately. Increase the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to strengthen field management. Cultivate strong seedlings to enhance plant disease resistance.
At present, there is no good Biological pest control method, and biocontrol agents can be used and biocontrol strains can be screened
Strengthen field management, timely intertillage and weeding, combined with thinning seedlings, early identification and removal of diseased plants.
["After the onset of the disease, the internodes of corn are shortened, the plant shape is shortened, and the leaf veins are extended to produce faded stripes. Early plant damage, growth stagnation, and premature death; Affected in the middle stage, the plant undergoes significant dwarfing, with clustered top leaves and difficult male flowers to emerge; In the later stage, the affected dwarf is not obvious and has a small impact on yield."]
["The disease signs of hereditary streaks of maize are the presence of maize streak virus (MSV) particles in the infected plant cells1. MSV is a geminivirus that has a circular, single-stranded DNA genome that encodes four proteins1. MSV particles have a characteristic geminate shape and can be observed under an electron microscope1."]
Genetic streak of maize is not caused by a phytopathogenic fungus, but by a transposable element (TE) or a "jumping gene" that can move within the genome and affect the expression of other genes1. The TE involved in genetic streak of maize is called Ds (Dissociation) and it can insert into or excise from a gene called C1 that controls the production of anthocyanin pigments in the maize kernels1. The resistance to genetic streak of maize is determined by the presence or absence of another TE called Ac (Activator) that can activate the movement of Ds1. If Ac is present, Ds can move in and out of C1, causing variegated color patterns on the kernels. If Ac is absent, Ds remains stable in C1, causing colorless kernels1. The mechanism of resistance is therefore based on the suppression of TE movement by the absence of Ac1. 
A quick test method for genetic streak of maize is to use molecular markers that can detect the presence or absence of Ds and Ac in the maize genome2. These markers can be based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (SSAP)2. These methods are fast, accurate, and reliable, and can be performed in a laboratory with appropriate equipment and reagents2. 
The mechanism of genetic infestation of genetic streak of maize involves the movement of Ds and Ac within the maize genome, which can affect the expression of C1 and other genes1. Ds and Ac belong to a class of TEs called class II TEs or DNA transposons, which move via a "cut-and-paste" mechanism that involves the excision and insertion of DNA segments1 3. The movement of Ds and Ac is regulated by several factors, such as DNA methylation, chromatin structure, and transcriptional activity3. The type and number of genes affected by Ds and Ac may differ among maize varieties, depending on the location and frequency of Ds and Ac insertion sites3. 
Genetic streak of maize is not caused by a phytopathogenic bacterium, so there are no potential targets of phytopathogenic bacteria involved.
