Corn is a type of staple crop that is widely grown and consumed around the world. It is also used for animal feed, biofuel and industrial products1. Corn small spot disease is a type of fungal disease caused by the pathogen Phyllachora maydis2 3. It is also known as tar spot or fisheye disease3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing asexual spores called conidia that are dispersed by wind or rain3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and crop residue4. The disease is more severe in regions with cool and humid conditions and where corn is grown continuously or in rotation with other hosts3. The fungus infects the corn leaves through natural openings or wounds and produces small, raised black spots called stromata3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the weather and the crop stage. The disease can infect corn plants at any growth stage, but symptoms usually appear after tasseling and become more evident during grain filling3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are cool temperatures (15-25Г‚В°C), high humidity (\&gt;75%) and frequent rainfall (\&gt;10 mm per week)3. The disease is favored by dense plantings, high nitrogen levels, low potassium levels and susceptible hybrids3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant residue on the soil surface or buried in the soil3. The fungus can also survive on alternative hosts such as weeds or grasses3.
Applying foliar fungicides with different modes of action can reduce the disease severity and protect the yield potential. The optimal timing for fungicide application is at or before the onset of symptoms, usually around VT-R1 stage1 2 3. The type of agent, application dose, application period and number of applications depend on the product label and the environmental conditions1 2 3. The control effect may vary depending on the disease pressure, the crop stage and the fungicide efficacy1 2 3.
Removing or burying the infected plant residue can reduce the inoculum source and prevent the overwintering of the fungus1 2 3. Cutting off the infected parts may not be feasible or effective for this disease1.
Using beneficial microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi or viruses that can antagonize or parasitize the pathogen can help suppress the disease development1. However, this method is not widely available or tested for this disease1.
Implementing crop rotation with non-host crops such as soybean, wheat or alfalfa can break the disease cycle and reduce the inoculum buildup1 2 3. Choosing resistant or tolerant hybrids can also help minimize the disease impact and improve the yield stability1 2 3. Adjusting the planting density, nitrogen level and potassium level can also influence the disease severity by affecting the microclimate and the plant health1 2.
["The formation of small, round or oval lesions that may be yellow, brown, or even a brownish purple in color on the corn leaves4.", "The lesions multiply quickly and form bands across leaves. You may also see the lesions on the stalks, husks, and sheaths of your corn plants4.", "The lesions coalesce and cause premature leaf senescence and necrosis2.", "The disease reduces the photosynthetic capacity and translocation of carbohydrates to the grain, resulting in lower yield and quality2."]
["The presence of small, raised black spots called stromata on the surface of the lesions2. These stromata are composed of fungal structures called pseudostromata that produce conidia2.", "The stromata can sometimes take on a вЂњfish-eyeвЂќ appearance with a tan center surrounded by a dark ring2.", "The stromata are difficult to remove from the leaf surface and give a sticky or tar-like appearance to the infected tissue2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but one study found a corn gene that confers partial resistance to multiple plant leaf diseases, including gray leaf spot1. The gene is called caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase and it is involved in the biosynthesis of lignin, a structural component of plant cell walls1. The mechanism of resistance is not clear, but it may involve altering the cell wall composition or signaling pathways to enhance the plant's defense response1. The type and level of resistance may vary depending on the corn genotype and the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is not available, as far as I can tell from my web searches. The disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium, so bacterial tests may not be applicable. The diagnosis of the disease is usually based on visual symptoms, such as small, round or oval lesions that may be yellow, brown, or purple in color2. However, these symptoms may be confused with other fungal diseases, such as anthracnose leaf blight, eyespot, or common rust3. Therefore, a more accurate test method may involve microscopic examination of the fungal structures or molecular identification of the fungal DNA4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is also not well understood, but some clues have been obtained from recent research. The fungus that causes the disease, Phyllachora maydis, is an obligate parasite that requires a living host to grow and reproduce4. It overwinters in corn residue and infects young corn leaves through wind-dispersed spores3 4. The infection occurs during prolonged warm and humid periods3. The fungus produces small, raised black spots called stromata on the leaves, husks and stalks of corn plants4. These stromata contain spores that can spread the disease to other plants or fields4. The stromata may also secrete toxins or enzymes that damage the plant tissue and reduce photosynthesis and yield4. The type and number of pathogenic effectors that the fungus uses to manipulate the plant's defense system are not known, but some proteins have been identified that may play a role in this process5. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the plant's genetic resistance, as mentioned in question 1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are also not well defined, but some candidates have been suggested based on previous studies. One possible target is the caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase gene that confers partial resistance to gray leaf spot and possibly other diseases1. Knocking out this gene may increase the susceptibility of corn plants to fungal infection by altering their cell wall composition or defense response1. Another possible target is the corn microbiome, which is the community of microorganisms that live on and inside corn plants5. Some of these microorganisms may have biocontrol potential against tar spot and other fungal diseases by competing with or antagonizing the pathogens5. Knocking out or disrupting these beneficial microorganisms may increase the vulnerability of corn plants to fungal infection by reducing their natural protection5.
