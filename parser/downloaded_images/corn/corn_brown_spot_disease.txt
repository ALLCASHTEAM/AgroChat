Corn is a staple crop and one of the most important cereal crops in the world. Corn brown spot disease is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Physoderma maydis, which belongs to the phylum Oomycota 1.
The pathogen of corn brown spot disease is Physoderma maydis, a fungus that produces brown sporangia that are packed inside infected cells. Each sporangium releases up to 50 motile zoospores that require both light and water to germinate and infect the plant. Infection most commonly occurs in the whorl where water tends to accumulate during periods of rain and irrigation, which is why lesions tend to develop in bands across the leaf 2.
Corn brown spot disease is usually more prevalent in wet growing seasons. Infection requires light, free water, and warm temperatures (75-85В°F).
The sporangia of Physoderma maydis can overwinter in infected corn tissue. It is said that they can survive in soil and crop debris for 2-7 years. The sporangia have the potential to release multiple zoospores with tails 3.
Chemical control involves the application of fungicides that can reduce the fungal infection and disease severity1.
The type, dose, period, and number of applications of fungicides may depend on the disease pressure, the crop stage, and the fungicide label.
The control effect of fungicides may vary from 10% to 80% depending on the factors mentioned above.
Agricultural control involves the use of crop rotation, tillage, and sanitation to reduce the inoculum sources and disease incidence1 2. Genetic control involves the development and use of disease-resistant corn hybrids that can tolerate or escape the fungal infection1 3.
["Symptoms of corn brown spot disease usually appear on mid-canopy leaves. Leaf lesions are numerous, very small (approximately Вј inch in diameter), round to oval, yellowish to brown in color, and usually occur in broad bands across the leaf. Alternating bands of infected and non-infected tissues are common. Dark purplish to black oval spots also occur on the midrib of the leaf. Symptoms may also occur on the stalk, leaf sheath, and husks4 ."]
["The disease signs of corn brown spot disease are the presence of brown sporangia that are packed inside infected cells1. These sporangia release up to 50 motile zoospores that require both light and water to germinate and infect the plant1. The sporangia and zoospores can be observed under a microscope or a magnifying lens."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of maize brown spot disease is not well studied. However, some studies have suggested that the fungus may have multiple mechanisms of resistance to fungicides, such as reducing the uptake of fungicides, altering the target site of fungicides, or detoxifying the fungicides1. The type and level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide group, the fungal strain, and the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of maize brown spot disease is to use a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) device that can detect the presence of fungal antigens in plant samples2. This method is rapid, simple, and low-cost, and can be performed in the field without specialized equipment or personnel2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of maize brown spot disease involves the infection of maize plants by fungal spores that germinate and penetrate the plant tissues, causing symptoms such as small circular spots that turn dark brown. The fungus may produce pathogenic effectors that modulate the plant immune system and facilitate the fungal colonization. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may differ among fungal species and strains, and may also depend on the host genotype and the biotic and abiotic stresses. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of maize brown spot disease are not well known. However, some studies have identified some genes that are involved in the bacterial pathogenesis or host resistance, such as type III secretion system (T3SS) genes, effector genes, plant defense genes, or signaling genes. These genes may be candidates for developing novel strategies to control the bacterial disease.
