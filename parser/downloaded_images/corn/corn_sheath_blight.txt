Corn is a type of cereal crop that can be used as a cash crop, a staple crop, or a feed crop depending on the variety and the market1 2. Corn blight is a general name for a group of fungal diseases that attack corn plants3. One of the most common types is northern corn leaf blight (NCLB), which is caused by the fungus Exserohilum turcicum2 4. Another type is seedling blight, which affects seeds and seedlings of corn and is caused by soil-borne fungi such as Pythium, Fusarium, Diplodia, Penicillium, and Rhizoctonia1 5.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of corn blight depends on the type of fungus. For NCLB, the fungus reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain2 4. For seedling blight, the fungi reproduce by producing various types of spores, such as zoospores, chlamydospores, or sclerotia, depending on the genus5. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of corn blight also depend on the type of fungus. For NCLB, the disease cycle begins when conidia germinate on wet leaves and infect the plant tissue. The fungus then grows within the leaf and produces more conidia that can infect other leaves or plants. The disease is favored by moderate temperatures (1827Г‚В°C) and high humidity (6 hours or more of leaf wetness per day)2 4. For seedling blight, the disease cycle begins when spores in the soil infect the seeds or roots of corn plants. The fungus then colonizes the plant tissue and causes rotting and wilting. The disease is favored by cool (10-15Г‚В°C) and wet soil conditions1 5.
The period of disease onset for corn blight varies depending on the type of fungus and the environmental conditions. For NCLB, the disease can appear at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during or after tasseling. The symptoms usually start on the lower leaves and move upward2 4. For seedling blight, the disease can appear before or after emergence, but it is more common in early-planted corn. The symptoms usually start on the roots or stems and move upward1 5. The environmental conditions required for corn blight are different for each type of fungus. For NCLB, the disease requires moderate temperatures (18-27Г‚В°C) and high humidity (6 hours or more of leaf wetness per day)2 4. For seedling blight, the disease requires cool (10-15Г‚В°C) and wet soil conditions1 5.
The overwintering method of corn blight depends on the type of fungus. For NCLB, the fungus survives on diseased plant parts or crop residues that remain in the field2 4. For seedling blight, the fungi survive as spores or sclerotia in the soil or on infected seeds1 5.
Fungicides such as azoxystrobin, propiconazole, pyraclostrobin, and tebuconazole can be applied to protect the foliage from infection and reduce yield loss6. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the corn hybrid resistance7.
Removing and destroying infected plant parts can help reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease8. Crop rotation with non-host plants such as soybean, wheat, or alfalfa can also reduce the fungal population in the soil9.
There are some reports of using antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, and Pseudomonas fluorescens to inhibit the growth and spore germination of the corn blight fungus10. However, more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of these biocontrol agents11.
Planting resistant or tolerant corn hybrids is one of the most effective ways to manage corn blight12. Avoiding planting corn in wet or poorly drained soils, and avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization can also help reduce the disease risk13. Adjusting planting dates and row spacing can improve air circulation and reduce leaf wetness14.
["Cigar-shaped lesions on the leaves that are tan to gray in color and range from one to six inches in length15. The lesions may coalesce and cover large areas of the leaf surface16.", "Reduced photosynthesis and transpiration, resulting in stunted growth and lower yield17.", "Increased susceptibility to stalk rot and ear rot pathogens18."]
["Dark brown to black spores of the fungus on the surface of the lesions19. The spores are elliptical and have a dark band across the middle20.", "Black fungal structures called setae that protrude from the spores21. The setae are stiff and pointed, and can be seen under a microscope22."]
The mechanism of resistance: The fungus can overcome the host resistance by mutating its avirulence genes or effectors that are recognized by the host resistance genes or proteins23. For example, the fungus can evade the recognition by Ht1 gene in maize by altering its avirulence gene PWL124. The fungus can also adapt to different environmental conditions and host genotypes by recombining its genetic material through sexual reproduction25. The type of resistance agent: The fungus can produce different types of toxins that can affect the host physiology and defense responses26. For example, the T-toxin produced by race T of the fungus is a host-selective toxin that can inhibit the mitochondrial respiration and induce cell death in maize plants with Texas male sterile cytoplasm27. The O-toxin produced by race O of the fungus is a non-host-selective toxin that can interfere with the photosynthesis and membrane integrity in maize plants28. The level of resistance: The level of resistance depends on the interaction between the fungal genotype and the host genotype, as well as the environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and inoculum density29. Generally, race T of the fungus is more virulent and aggressive than race O, and can cause more severe disease symptoms and yield loss30. However, race O can also cause significant damage under favorable conditions31. 
One possible method is to use molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the specific DNA sequences of the fungus in the infected plant tissues32. These methods are rapid, sensitive, and specific, but require specialized equipment and reagents33. Another possible method is to use immunological techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) to detect the specific antigens or toxins of the fungus in the infected plant tissues34. These methods are simple, inexpensive, and portable, but may have lower sensitivity and specificity than molecular methods35. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus can secrete various types of effectors that can modulate the host defense responses and facilitate the infection process36. Some of these effectors are secreted into the apoplast (the space between the plant cell wall and membrane), while others are delivered into the plant cell cytoplasm through a specialized structure called biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC)37. The exact number of effectors is unknown, but a recent study identified 248 candidate effector genes in the genome of race T of the fungus38. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus can infect different plants by recognizing their specific susceptibility factors or avoiding their specific resistance factors39. For example, maize plants with Texas male sterile cytoplasm have a mitochondrial protein called URF13 that is required for T-toxin binding and induction of cell death40. Maize plants with normal cytoplasm do not have this protein and are resistant to T-toxin41. Similarly, maize plants with Ht1 gene have a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein that can recognize PWL1 effector and trigger defense responses42. Maize plants without Ht1 gene do not have this protein and are susceptible to PWL1 effector43. 
Knockout lethal genes: These are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of the fungus, and their disruption or deletion would result in reduced virulence or inviability44. Some examples of knockout lethal genes in race T of the fungus are ETG1 (encoding a glycosyl hydrolase), ETG2 (encoding a glycosyl transferase), ETG3 (encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase), and ETG4 (encoding a methyltransferase)45. These genes are involved in various metabolic pathways such as cell wall biosynthesis, toxin production, detoxification, and stress response46.
