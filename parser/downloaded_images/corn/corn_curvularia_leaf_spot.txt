Zea mays is a staple crop that is widely cultivated for its edible grains1 2. Zea mays leaf spot disease can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as fungal, bacterial, or oomycete2. Some examples of fungal pathogens are Kabatiella zeae (eyespot) and Cercospora zeae-maydis (gray leaf spot)3 4. An example of a bacterial pathogen is Erwinia stewartii (bacterial leaf blight)2. An example of an oomycete pathogen is Peronosclerospora sorghi (downy mildew)2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease depends on the species. For example, Kabatiella zeae produces unicellular, colourless, ellipsoidal, slightly curved conidia3, while Cercospora zeae-maydis produces hyaline, cylindrical to fusiform conidia4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease also depend on the species. For example, Kabatiella zeae is transmitted by airborne conidia that infect young leaves and require high humidity and moderate temperatures for infection3, while Cercospora zeaemaydis is transmitted by airborne ascospores that infect older leaves and require high humidity and warm temperatures for infection4.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the species and the environmental conditions. For example, Kabatiella zeae can cause symptoms as early as June in some regions3, while Cercospora zeae-maydis can cause symptoms as late as August in some regions4. The environmental conditions required for the disease depend on the species. For example, Kabatiella zeae prefers high humidity and moderate temperatures (18-25Г‚В°C) for infection3, while Cercospora zeae-maydis prefers high humidity and warm temperatures (24-30Г‚В°C) for infection4. Soil conditions may also affect the disease severity, such as soil pH, nitrogen level, and moisture content2.
The overwintering method of this disease depends on the species. For example, Kabatiella zeae can overwinter as mycelium or conidia on infected plant debris or seeds3, while Cercospora zeae-maydis can overwinter as pseudothecia on infected plant debris or seeds4.
Fungicides can be applied to prevent or reduce fungal infections, such as gray leaf spot and eyespot. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product and the environmental conditions. For example, some studies have reported that fungicides containing strobilurins, triazoles, or benzimidazoles can effectively control gray leaf spot1 2. However, fungicide resistance may develop in some fungal populations2. Therefore, fungicide application should be based on disease forecasting and economic threshold1.
Infected plant parts can be removed or destroyed to reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease. This can be done by pruning, burning, or burying the infected leaves, stalks, or ears3. However, this method may not be feasible for large-scale production or severe infections.
Some natural enemies or antagonists can be used to suppress the growth or activity of the pathogens. For example, some studies have reported that Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, and Pseudomonas fluorescens can inhibit the growth of Cercospora zeae-maydis in vitro and reduce gray leaf spot severity in vivo4 5. However, biological control may not be consistent or effective under different environmental conditions or pathogen strains.
Some cultural practices can be adopted to reduce the disease risk and severity. For example, crop rotation, intercropping, or cover cropping can break the disease cycle and reduce the inoculum level1 3. Planting resistant or tolerant varieties can also enhance the host defense and limit the disease development1 2. Adjusting the planting date, density, row spacing, or irrigation can also affect the microclimate and the disease incidence1 3.
["Gray leaf spot: This disease causes rectangular or oblong lesions on the leaves that are gray to tan in color and have brown or purple margins. The lesions are usually parallel to the veins and may coalesce to form large necrotic areas. The infected leaves may wilt, dry up, or fall off prematurely1 2.", "Eyespot: This disease causes small, round to oval spots on the leaves that are light-colored and translucent with a red-brown ring and a chlorotic yellow halo. The spots are usually scattered over the leaf surface and may merge to form irregular blotches. The infected leaves may show reduced photosynthesis and yield3."]
["Bacterial leaf blight: The sign of this disease is the presence of bacterial structures such as cells, colonies, or exudates on the infected leaves. These structures can be observed under a microscope or with a staining technique. The bacterial cells are rod-shaped, gram-negative, and motile. The bacterial colonies are yellow, mucoid, and circular. The bacterial exudates are yellowish, sticky, and soluble in water.", "Downy mildew: The sign of this disease is the presence of fungal structures such as sporangia (spore sacs), sporangiophores (sporangia-bearing structures), or oospores (resting spores) on the infected leaves. These structures can be observed under a microscope or with a hand lens. The sporangia are lemon-shaped, hyaline, and multicellular. The sporangiophores are branched and dichotomous. The oospores are thick-walled, spherical, and dark brown."]
Detoxification: Some fungal strains can detoxify the host defense compounds, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, or phytoalexins, by using enzymes such as flavin-monooxygenases (FMOs), cytochrome P450s (CYPs), or glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)1 2. For example, some strains of Cercospora zeae-maydis can detoxify kauralexin, a maize phytoalexin, by using a FMO gene1. Effector secretion: Some fungal strains can secrete effectors that manipulate the host immune system, such as suppressing the host defense responses, altering the host metabolism, or enhancing the fungal virulence2 3. For example, some strains of Cercospora zeae-maydis can secrete a necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like protein (NEP1) that induces cell death and chlorosis in maize leaves3. Fungicide resistance: Some fungal strains can develop resistance to fungicides that are used to control the disease, such as strobilurins, triazoles, or benzimidazoles2 4. The mechanisms of fungicide resistance may include target site mutations, overexpression of efflux pumps, or degradation of fungicides4. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that can detect and identify the bacterial DNA in the infected plant samples5. The PCR assay can be performed using specific primers that target the bacterial genes or regions that are unique to the pathogen. For example, a PCR assay can be used to detect Erwinia stewartii, the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight, by using primers that target the wtsE gene that encodes a pathogenicity factor5. The PCR assay can provide a rapid and accurate diagnosis of the bacterial infection. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease depends on the type and number of pathogenic effectors that the pathogen produces and delivers into the host cells. Pathogenic effectors are molecules that can modulate the host physiology and immunity to facilitate the pathogen colonization and reproduction. The type and number of effectors may vary depending on the pathogen species and strain. For example, Erwinia stewartii produces and secretes several effectors that can cause wilting, chlorosis, and necrosis in maize leaves, such as WtsE (a type III secretion system effector), Stewartan (an exopolysaccharide), and Zeamine (a phytotoxin) . Cercospora zeae-maydis produces and secretes several effectors that can cause gray leaf spot lesions in maize leaves, such as Czr1 (a transcription factor), Cercosporin (a toxin), and NEP1 (a necrosis-inducing protein) . The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the compatibility or specificity between the pathogen effectors and the host receptors or targets. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are the host genes or proteins that are involved in the plant defense or metabolism. By targeting these host factors, the bacteria can manipulate the host responses and gain an advantage over the host. For example, Erwinia stewartii targets a maize gene called ZmRIP1 that encodes a receptor-like protein kinase involved in plant immunity. By suppressing ZmRIP1 expression, Erwinia stewartii can evade the host recognition and induce susceptibility. Another example is Erwinia stewartii targets a maize gene called ZmLOX10 that encodes a lipoxygenase involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis. By inducing ZmLOX10 expression, Erwinia stewartii can interfere with the salicylic acid pathway and promote disease development .
