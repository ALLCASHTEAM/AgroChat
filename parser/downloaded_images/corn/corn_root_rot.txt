Corn is a type of staple crop that is widely grown and consumed around the world1. Corn root rot leaf spot is a type of fungal disease that affects the leaves and roots of corn plants2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of corn root rot leaf spot is Cercospora zeae-maydis, which reproduces by producing conidia (asexual spores) that are dispersed by wind or rain2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of corn root rot leaf spot are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and crop residue4 3. The disease is more severe in areas with minimum tillage and corn on corn rotations, as these practices favor the survival and spread of the fungus1. The disease can also be transmitted by airborne spores that infect the lower leaves early in the season and then move up to the higher leaves or neighboring fields1.
The period of disease onset for corn root rot leaf spot varies depending on the weather conditions and the susceptibility of the corn variety2 3. The disease can start as early as two weeks after planting or as late as tasseling3. The disease can progress rapidly during periods of warm temperatures (greater than 24В°C) and high humidity (greater than 95%) or wet weather2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are similar to those that favor its onset and development, namely warm temperatures (greater than 24В°C) and high humidity (greater than 95%) or wet weather2. The disease also prefers neutral to alkaline soil pH and high levels of nitrogen fertilization3.
The overwintering method of this disease is through infected crop residue that remains on the soil surface after harvest2 3. The fungus can survive on the residue for up to two years and produce spores that initiate new infections in the next season3.
Fungicide seed treatments can help prevent or reduce root rot infections by various fungi, such as Fusarium, Pythium, and Rhizoctonia1 2. Foliar fungicides can also help control leaf spot diseases caused by fungi, such as gray leaf spot and common rust3 2. However, fungicides should be used only when economically warranted and according to label directions.
Removing infected plant debris and tillage can help reduce the inoculum of fungal pathogens that survive in the soil or on crop residue3 2 4. Cutting off the infected parts of the plant may not be feasible or effective for root rot or leaf spot diseases.
There is limited information on biological control agents for corn root rot or leaf spot diseases. Some studies have suggested that certain strains of bacteria or fungi may have antagonistic effects on some root rot pathogens, but their efficacy and availability are uncertain5.
Crop rotation with non-host crops can help break the disease cycle and reduce the inoculum of fungal pathogens that cause root rot or leaf spot diseases3 2 4. Choosing resistant or tolerant corn hybrids can also help minimize the impact of these diseases3 2 4. Avoiding plant stress by maintaining proper soil fertility, irrigation, and weed control can also reduce the susceptibility of corn plants to root rot or leaf spot diseases2 4.
["Root rot: Yellowing leaves, wilting, stunting, poor growth, and reduced yield are common symptoms of root rot diseases . The roots may be discolored, decayed, or rotted. The crown and lower stem may also show signs of rotting and discoloration6 . A foul odor may emanate from the soil or the infected plant parts7 8.", "Leaf spot: Small to large spots or lesions of various shapes and colors may appear on the leaves, depending on the causal agent. For example, gray leaf spot causes rectangular lesions that are restricted by the leaf veins9, while common rust causes small, oval dark-reddish-brown pustules on both leaf surfaces9. The spots or lesions may coalesce and cause premature leaf death or defoliation9 6."]
["Root rot: The presence of fungal mycelium, spores, or fruiting structures on the roots or the soil may indicate root rot infection by different fungi. For example, Fusarium root rot may produce white to pink mycelium or microsclerotia (small black structures) on the roots, while Pythium root rot may produce cottony mycelium on the roots or the soil surface.", "Leaf spot: The presence of fungal spores, pustules, or fruiting structures on the leaf spots or lesions may indicate leaf spot infection by different fungi. For example, gray leaf spot may produce conidia (asexual spores) in acervuli (small black structures) on the lesions9, while common rust may produce urediniospores (reddish-brown spores) in pustules on the leaf surface9."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the species of Bipolaris that causes the leaf spot. According to a study by Xiaofang Sun et al. 1, B. maydis and B. zeicola are the dominant pathogenic species in Sichuan, China, and they have different distribution patterns and symptoms on maize. The study did not mention the mechanism of resistance, the type of resistance agent, or the level of resistance of these fungi, so I do not have that information. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with specific primers for B. maydis and B. zeicola. This method can detect and identify these fungi from infected maize leaves within 24 hours 1. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the production of toxins and enzymes by the Bipolaris fungi that damage the maize cells and tissues. The type and number of pathogenic effector vary depending on the fungal species and strain. For example, B. maydis produces a host-specific toxin called T-toxin that is essential for its virulence on maize B. zeicola produces a phytotoxic metabolite called zeicola-toxin that induces necrosis on maize leaves. The differences in infestation of different plants are related to the host specificity and genetic diversity of the Bipolaris fungi 1 . 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not clear, as there is little information on the bacterial causes of root rot leaf spot of maize. One possible bacterium is Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, which causes holcus leaf spot, a common bacterial disease on maize 2. However, I do not have information on the knockout lethal genes or other targets of this bacterium on maize.
