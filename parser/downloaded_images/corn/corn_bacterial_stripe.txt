The type of crop of this plant: Corn (<em>Zea mays</em>) is a staple crop that is widely grown for human and animal consumption, as well as for industrial uses such as ethanol production47. The type of disease of this disease: Bacterial streak disease of corn is a bacterial disease caused by the pathogen <em>Xanthomonas vasicola</em> pv. <em>vasculorum </em>(synonym <em>X. campestris</em> pv. <em>zeae</em>)48.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease: The pathogen is not a fungus, but a bacterium that reproduces by binary fission, which is a process of splitting into two identical cells49. The bacterium can also form spores that can survive in harsh conditions and germinate when favorable conditions return50. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease: The disease is favored by warm and humid conditions, and can spread by rain splash, irrigation water, wind, insects, and contaminated equipment51. The bacterium can enter the plant through natural openings such as stomata or wounds52. The disease can also be seed-borne or soil-borne53.
The period of disease onset for this disease: The disease can occur at any stage of corn growth, but symptoms are usually more visible after tasseling54. The incubation period (the time between infection and symptom development) can range from a few days to several weeks, depending on the environmental conditions and the host susceptibility55. The environmental conditions required for the disease: The disease requires warm (75-90В°F) and humid (=&gt;90% relative humidity) conditions for infection and symptom development56. The disease is more severe in areas with frequent rainfall or irrigation and in fields with high plant density or excessive nitrogen fertilization57.
The overwintering method of this disease: The bacterium can overwinter in infected corn debris or seeds, or alternative hosts such as sugarcane or sorghum58. The bacterium can also survive in soil or water for several months59.
There is no evidence that foliar fungicides are effective against this bacterial disease1. Copper-based bactericides may have some efficacy, but their use is not recommended due to phytotoxicity and environmental concerns2.
Sanitation practices such as cleaning debris from combine and other equipment between fields can help slow the spread of the disease to unaffected fields1. Cutting off the infected parts may not be feasible or practical for large-scale corn production.
There is no information available on biological control agents for this disease.
Crop rotation or tillage may help degrade infected corn debris and reduce the surviving bacteria, but neither practice will eradicate the bacterium and eliminate the risk of disease1. Planting resistant hybrids or varieties may be the best option for managing this disease, but more research is needed to identify and develop resistant germplasm3.
["The symptoms include interveinal leaf streaks that are brown, tan, or yellow and can be short or very long4. Lesions are also strikingly yellow when backlit against the sun4. Lesions usually have slightly wavy edges in contrast to the smooth, linear lesion margins of gray leaf spot1. Symptoms most often develop initially on the lower leaves, but can also occur in the mid-to upper canopy following storms or heavy rains4."]
["The signs of this disease are the physical evidence of the bacterium itself on the plant. The bacterium can be observed under a microscope as streaming out of the cut ends of infected leaf tissue4. The bacterium can also be cultured on a specific medium (NBY) that produces yellow colonies with a mucoid appearance2."]
Mechanism of resistance: There is no information available on the mechanism of resistance of the bacterium <em>Xanthomonas vasicola</em> pv. <em>vasculorum</em>, which causes a bacterial leaf streak of corn. Type of resistance agent: There is no information available on the type of resistance agent that can be used against this bacterium. Level of resistance: There is no information available on the level of resistance of this bacterium to any potential agents. 
The most reliable method for diagnosing bacterial leaf streaks of corn is to observe the bacterial streaming from the cut ends of infected leaf tissue under a microscope1. This requires a laboratory setting and specialized equipment. Another method is to culture the bacterium on a specific medium (NBY) that produces yellow colonies with a mucoid appearance2. This also requires a laboratory setting and specialized equipment. A field-based method that can help distinguish bacterial leaf streaks from gray leaf spots is to backlight the lesions against the sun. Bacterial leaf streak lesions appear yellow, while gray leaf spot lesions appear brown1. However, this method is not definitive and may vary depending on the hybrid and environmental conditions. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: There is no information available on the type and number of pathogenic effectors that are involved in the infection process of this bacterium. Differences in infestation of different plants: This bacterium has been reported to infect corn, sugarcane, and sorghum, but the differences in infestation of these plants are not well understood. In sugarcane, the bacterium causes gumming disease, which affects the vascular system and reduces sucrose content3. In sorghum, the bacterium causes bacterial leaf streak, which reduces photosynthesis and yield4. In corn, the bacterium also causes bacterial leaf streaks, but its impact on yield is not known yet5.
