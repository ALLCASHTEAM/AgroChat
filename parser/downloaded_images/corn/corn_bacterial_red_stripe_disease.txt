Corn is a type of staple crop that is widely grown and consumed as a source of food, feed, fuel, and industrial products1. Bacterial red streak disease of corn is a type of bacterial disease that is caused by the bacterium <em>Xanthomonas vasicola</em>. The disease has been observed on field corn, seed corn, popcorn, and sweet corn. The disease is also known as bacterial leaf streak2.
The pathogenic bacterium that causes bacterial red streak disease of corn reproduces by binary fission, which is a process of asexual reproduction where one bacterial cell divides into two identical daughter cells3. The bacterium survives in infested corn debris near the soil surface and can be splashed onto new plants by rain or irrigation4. The bacterium can enter the plant through natural openings or wounds caused by wind, hail, insects, or mechanical damage2. The disease can occur at any growth stage of corn, but it is more severe when infection occurs early in the season2.
Symptoms can appear as early as the V4 growth stage in the field, but they are more common after tasseling2. The bacterium prefers warm (greater than 80 ВєF) and humid conditions for optimal disease development2.
The overwintering method of bacterial red streak disease of corn is not well understood. It is assumed that the bacterium overwinters in infested corn debris near the soil surface that serves as a source of inoculum for new infections2.
There is no effective chemical control for this disease, as fungicides do not work against bacteria1 2 3 4. Antibiotics are not recommended for field use due to environmental and regulatory concerns5.
There are no specific physical measures for this disease, but removing infected plant debris after harvest may help reduce inoculum for the next season5 2.
There is no known biological control for this disease5.
The best agricultural practices to manage this disease are crop rotation, planting resistant or tolerant hybrids, avoiding overhead irrigation, and minimizing plant stress5 1 2 3 4.
["Symptoms of bacterial leaf streak are tan, brown, or orange lesions that occur between the veins of the corn leaves. Lesions are long, narrow, and less than 1 inch to several inches long. Lesions also can occur close to the leaf midrib or across the leaf blade"]
["Disease signs of this disease are the presence of bacterial streaming from the lesions when observed under a microscope. This can be done by cutting a small piece of infected leaf tissue and placing it in a drop of water on a glass slide. The bacteria can be seen as thin strands coming out of the leaf tissue5 2. Another sign of this disease is the production of a slimy substance by the bacteria on the leaf surface, which may be visible as droplets or streaks5."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: I do not have this information. The disease is caused by a bacterium, not a fungus1 2 3 4. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: I do not have this information. The disease is caused by a bacterium, not a fungus1 2 3 4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease: I do not have this information. The bacterium can enter the plant through stomata or wounds and move from residue onto living plant tissue via rain splash2 3. The bacterium may produce a slimy substance on the leaf surface3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease: I do not have this information.
