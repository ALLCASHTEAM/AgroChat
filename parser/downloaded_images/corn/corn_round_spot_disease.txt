Corn is a type of staple crop that is widely grown and consumed around the world1. Corn round spot disease is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Physoderma maydis2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of corn round spot disease reproduces by producing sporangia that contain zoospores. Zoospores are mobile spores that can swim in water and infect the plant tissue2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of corn round spot disease are influenced by warm and wet conditions, especially during the early stages of corn development. The zoospores can be dispersed by rain splash, irrigation water, or windblown water droplets. The disease can also be transmitted by infected seeds or plant debris2 3.
The period of disease onset for corn round spot disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the corn variety. The disease can appear as early as the two-leaf stage or as late as the tasseling stage. The symptoms usually develop within 7 to 10 days after infection2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity, free water, and warm temperatures (between 25В°C and 30В°C). The disease is more severe in poorly drained soils, low-lying areas, or shaded fields2 3.
The overwintering method of corn round spot disease is through the survival of the fungus in the soil or on the infected plant residue. The fungus can also survive on the seed coat of infected seeds2.
Applying fungicides at the early stages of corn development or before the disease symptoms appear can help reduce the disease severity and yield loss. The type of fungicide, application dose, application period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the environmental conditions1 2. The control effect of fungicides may vary depending on the corn variety and the disease pressure2.
Removing and destroying the infected plant parts or plant debris can help reduce the inoculum source and prevent the disease spread3.
There is no known biological control agent for this disease.
Using resistant or tolerant corn varieties, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, improving soil drainage, and practicing crop rotation with non-host crops can help reduce the disease incidence and severity3 4.
["Small, round, yellow spots on leaves and sheaths that appear in bands across the leaf. The spots turn brown and coalesce to form larger blotches. The infected leaf tissue decomposes, releasing brown spores3.", "Stalks often break and lodge due to weakened plant tissue3."]
["The presence of brown spores on the infected plant parts, especially on the lower leaf surface3.", "The presence of sporangia and zoospores under a microscope or a magnifying lens2."]
The mechanism of resistance may involve the ability of the fungus to produce zoospores that can swim and infect the plant tissue, and to produce sporangia that can survive in adverse conditions1. The type of resistance agent may depend on the fungicide used to control the disease. Some fungicides may have a protective effect, preventing the infection of new plant tissue, while others may have a curative effect, reducing the infection of already infected plant tissue2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the corn variety, the environmental conditions, and the disease pressure. Some corn varieties may have resistance or tolerance to the disease, while others may be highly susceptible3 . The environmental conditions that favor the disease are high humidity, free water, and warm temperatures1 3. The disease pressure may depend on the amount of inoculum source in the soil or on the plant debris3. 
Observing the disease symptoms and signs on the plant parts, such as the small, round, yellow spots that turn brown and coalesce on the leaves and sheaths, and the presence of brown spores on the infected tissue3. Using a microscope or a magnifying lens to examine the infected plant tissue for the presence of sporangia and zoospores, which are characteristic structures of the fungus1 2. Performing a molecular test, such as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to detect the specific DNA sequence of the fungus from the infected plant tissue. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors that the fungus produces to manipulate or suppress the plant defense responses. For example, some fungal pathogens can secrete proteins that act as toxins, enzymes, or suppressors of plant immunity. The differences in infestation of different plants depending on their genetic susceptibility or resistance to the fungus. For example, some corn varieties may have genes that confer resistance to corn round spot disease by recognizing specific pathogen effectors and triggering defense responses . The interaction between the fungus and other biotic or abiotic factors that may influence its pathogenicity. For example, some fungal pathogens can form symbiotic relationships with insects that help them disperse or infect plants. Some environmental factors, such as temperature, moisture, or nutrient availability, may also affect the fungal growth and infection1 3. 
The response and stress tolerance of bZIP28 transcription factor after infection by corn round spot fungus were investigated, and it was found that ZmbZIP 28 had the most obvious up-regulation trend, and B-subfamily transcription factors participated in the pathogen response pathway. This transcription factor may be a potential target of corn round spot fungus4.
