The type of crop of maize is a staple crop1 that is grown for its edible grain and used for food, feed, and industrial purposes2. The type of disease of maize red leaf disease is a viral disease3 caused by Wheat mosaic virus (WMoV), formerly known as Maize red stripe virus4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic virus of this disease is by producing viral particles that are encapsidated by a protein coat and contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by several factors, such as the presence of insect vectors, especially leafhoppers, that can acquire and transmit the virus in a persistent manner5. The virus can also be transmitted by mechanical inoculation or through infected seeds4.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the stage of plant development, but it is generally observed that the disease symptoms appear two to three weeks after infection4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are not well studied, but it is likely that the disease is favored by warm temperatures and high humidity that promote vector activity and virus replication4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in infected seeds or alternative hosts such as wheat, barley, rye, or oats4.
Use of resistant or tolerant varieties that can withstand the virus infection and reduce yield losses1.Seed treatment with appropriate chemicals to prevent seed-borne transmission of the virus2.
Roguing and destroying infected plants to prevent virus spread and inoculum buildup3.
Controlling weed hosts such as wheat, barley, rye, or oats that can harbor the virus and serve as sources of infection4.
Managing insect vectors using cultural practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, trap crops, or biological control agents, or using insecticides when necessary3 4.
["Red stripes on the leaves that may be continuous or discontinuous, and may vary in width and length depending on the virus strain and the plant genotype4.", "Stunted growth and reduced tillering due to shortened internodes, resulting in a bunchy appearance of the plant4.", "Reduced ear formation and development, leading to low yield and quality4."]
["Presence of insect vectors, especially leafhoppers, on the leaves or stems of corn plants4.", "Detection of viral particles or antigens using molecular or serological techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not relevant, as the disease is caused by a virus, not a fungus. However, there is resistance to the virus in maize plants. Maize plants can have up to five resistance genes in their genetic makeup. There are commercially available hybrids that provide good resistance. The major gene for resistance is called mdm1 and it is found on chromosome 61 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not available, as the fungus is not the causal agent of the disease. However, a quick test method for the virus is by using serological techniques, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), that can detect viral antigens in plant sap3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not applicable, as the disease is not caused by a fungus. However, the mechanism of viral infection of the disease is by entering the plant cells through wounds or aphid vectors and replicating in the cytoplasm3. The virus can also move from cell to cell through plasmodesmata and from organ to organ through phloem3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not relevant, as the disease is caused by a virus and a fungus, not a bacterium.
