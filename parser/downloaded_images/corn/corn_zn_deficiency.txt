Maize is a type of staple crop that is widely cultivated for human and animal consumption, as well as for industrial purposes1. Zn deficiency in maize is not a disease caused by a pathogen, but a physiological disorder caused by a lack of Zn availability in the soil or plant2.
Since Zn deficiency is not a fungal disease, there is no pathogenic fungus or mode of reproduction involved. Since Zn deficiency is not a transmissible disease, there is no epidemiological pattern or mode of transmission involved.
The period of disease onset for Zn deficiency in maize may vary depending on the soil type, the plant genotype, and the growth stage2. However, some studies have reported that Zn deficiency symptoms may appear as early as the two-leaf stage3 or as late as the tasseling stage4. The environmental conditions required for Zn deficiency in maize are mainly related to the soil factors that affect Zn availability and uptake by plants. These factors include high soil pH, high calcium carbonate content, high phosphorus content, low organic matter content, and drought stress2 .
Since Zn deficiency is not a biotic disease, there is no overwintering method involved.
Chemical control involves the application of Zn fertilizers or Zn foliar sprays to increase the Zn availability and uptake by plants1.
The type, dose, period, and number of applications of Zn fertilizers may depend on the soil type, the crop requirement, and the fertilizer formulation.
The control effect of Zn fertilizers may vary from 10% to 80% depending on the factors mentioned above.
Agricultural control involves the use of organic amendments, such as manure, compost, or biochar, to enhance the Zn solubility and mobility in the soil1 . Genetic control involves the development and use of Zn-efficient maize varieties that can maintain high yield and quality under Zn-deficient conditions1 . These varieties may have enhanced Zn uptake, translocation, and utilization mechanisms, as well as improved tolerance to Zn deficiency stress1 .
["Moderate deficiencies in seedlings may result in white to pale-yellow longitudinal areas in the newest leaves that are usually more pronounced in the lower half of the leaf. Severe deficiencies at this time may result in entire plants being pale yellow to white in color, and stunted2.", "Moderate deficiencies may result in interveinal chlorosis (white or yellow) in the newest growth. This chlorosis is not always uniform across the width of the leaf, but may appear as longitudinal "bands" of more chlorotic tissue. Areas of the leaf near the stalk may develop a general white to yellow discoloration2.", "More severe zinc deficiencies may result in bands of pale yellow to white tissue running longitudinally along both sides of the midrib, particularly in the lower half of the leaf. This tissue may eventually wilt and become necrotic. Plants may appear stunted due to shortened leaves and internodes, sometimes called "rosetting."2"]
["Since Zn deficiency is not a biotic disease, there are no disease signs or physical evidence of a pathogen involved."]
Since Zn deficiency is not a fungal disease, there is no phytopathogenic fungus or resistance mechanism involved. 
Since Zn deficiency is not a fungal disease, there is no quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus involved. 
Since Zn deficiency is not a biotic disease, there is no phytopathogenic infestation mechanism involved. 
Since Zn deficiency is not a bacterial disease, there are no phytopathogenic bacteria or potential targets involved.
