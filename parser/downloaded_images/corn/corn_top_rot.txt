The type of crop of this plant: Corn is a staple crop that is widely grown and consumed around the world. It is also used for animal feed, ethanol production, and industrial purposes1. The type of disease of this disease: Corn top rot is a fungal disease that affects the upper part of the corn plant, causing wilting, browning, and death of the leaves and tassels. It is caused by several species of fungi, such as Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium subglutinans, and Colletotrichum graminicola2 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease: The pathogenic fungi of this disease reproduce by producing spores that can be dispersed by wind, rain, insects, or infected plant debris. Some fungi produce different types of spores, such as conidia, ascospores, or macroconidia, depending on the environmental conditions2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease: Corn top rot is a polycyclic disease that can have multiple cycles of infection and spore production within a growing season. The disease is transmitted by airborne spores that land on the leaves or tassels and germinate under favorable conditions. The spores can also be carried by insects such as corn earworms or European corn borers that feed on the plant tissues and create wounds for fungal entry4 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease: Corn top rot can occur at any stage of corn development, but it is more common and severe during the reproductive stages, especially after silking. The disease can cause poor pollination, reduced grain fill, and ear rot2 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease: Corn top rot is favored by warm, humid, and wet conditions that promote spore germination and infection. The optimal temperature range for fungal growth is between 77В°F and 86В°F. Frequent rainfall, irrigation, dew formation, or high relative humidity (&gt;90%) increase the risk of disease development2 3.
The overwintering method of this disease: The pathogenic fungi of this disease can overwinter on infected plant debris in the soil or on the surface. They can also survive on alternative hosts such as weeds or grasses. The spores can remain viable for several months or years until favorable conditions occur for infection2 3.
Fungicides can be applied at planting or during the growing season to protect the plants from fungal infection. However, fungicides may not be effective against all species of fungi that cause corn top rot, and their efficacy may depend on the timing, rate, and frequency of application1 2. Some examples of fungicides that can be used for corn top rot are azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, propiconazole, and tebuconazole3.
Removing or burying the infected plant debris can help reduce the inoculum source and prevent spore dispersal. Avoiding mechanical or insect damage to the plants can also reduce the entry points for fungal infection. Cultivating the soil around the crown may promote nodal root development and help plants recover2.
There is limited information on biological control agents for corn top rot. Some studies have reported that certain strains of bacteria (e.g., Bacillus subtilis) or fungi (e.g., Trichoderma harzianum) can inhibit the growth of Fusarium species in vitro or in greenhouse conditions, but their field efficacy is unknown .
Practicing crop rotation, especially with non-host crops such as soybean or wheat, can help reduce the fungal inoculum in the soil and break the disease cycle. Managing plant population, fertility, irrigation, and weed control can also help reduce plant stress and enhance plant resistance1 2.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: According to 1, the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease, Colletotrichum graminicola, has a high level of genetic diversity and can overcome the resistance of maize hybrids by producing different races or strains. The mechanism of resistance involves the interaction between fungal effectors and plant resistance genes, which can trigger plant defense responses or susceptibility depending on the compatibility1 2. The type of resistant agent can be either major genes that confer race-specific resistance or minor genes that confer partial or quantitative resistance1 3. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: I could not find any information on a quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease. However, some studies have reported the use of Raman spectroscopy as a potential tool for rapid and non-destructive diagnosis of stalk rot disease in maize4 5. Raman spectroscopy is a technique that measures the vibrational modes of molecules in a sample and generates a unique spectral fingerprint. The Raman spectra can be used to identify and differentiate fungal pathogens and infected plant tissues based on their biochemical composition4 5. 
The fungus produces spores (conidia) that are dispersed by wind or rain and land on the plant surface. The spores germinate and penetrate the plant cuticle and epidermis by producing appressoria (specialized infection structures). The fungus grows inside the plant tissue and forms biotrophic hyphae that interact with living plant cells and extract nutrients without killing them. The fungus switches to a necrotrophic phase and produces necrotrophic hyphae that kill plant cells and cause tissue maceration and rotting. The fungus produces acervuli (fruiting bodies) that emerge from the infected tissue and release new spores for secondary infection1 2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease: I could not find any information on the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease. Top rot of maize is caused by a fungal pathogen, not a bacterial one.
