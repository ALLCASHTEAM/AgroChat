Corn is a type of staple crop that is widely grown and consumed around the world. It is also used for animal feed, ethanol production, and industrial purposes1. Corn sunburn is not a disease, but a physiological disorder caused by excessive exposure to direct sunlight. It can cause the leaves to turn yellow, brown, or white, and reduce the photosynthetic capacity of the plant1 2.
Since corn sunburn is not a disease, it does not involve a pathogenic fungus or any other microorganism. Therefore, it does not have a mode of reproduction. Corn sunburn is not transmitted by any agent, but occurs when the plant is exposed to high levels of solar radiation, especially during midday hours. It can be aggravated by factors such as water stress, nutrient deficiency, insect damage, or herbicide injury3 4.
Corn sunburn can occur at any stage of growth, but it is more likely to affect young plants that have not developed enough leaf area or wax layer to protect themselves from the sun1 4. Corn sunburn requires high temperatures and intense sunlight to occur. It can be prevented or reduced by providing adequate irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and weed management. Planting corn at optimal densities and orientations can also help to create a canopy that shades the lower leaves1 4.
Corn sunburn does not overwinter, as it is not a disease. However, corn plants that have suffered from sunburn may be more susceptible to other diseases or pests that can overwinter in crop residues or soil1 4.
No chemical controls
Provide adequate irrigation to ensure that the plants have enough water, ensuring that the plants have enough foliage to shade the developing ears, and avoiding over-pruning or removing leaves that provide shade to the ears.
No biological controls
To prevent sunscald in corn, you can take several agricultural measures such as providing adequate irrigation to ensure that the plants have enough water, ensuring that the plants have enough foliage to shade the developing ears, avoiding over-pruning or removing leaves that provide shade to the ears, and selecting varieties that are well-suited to your growing conditions.
["Yellowing, browning, or whitening of the leaf tissue, especially on the upper surface and along the leaf margins1 .", "Reduced photosynthetic capacity and transpiration rate of the affected leaves.", "Increased water loss and wilting of the plants under severe stress.", "Reduced plant growth, ear size, and grain yield under prolonged or repeated exposure1 ."]
["The occurrence of high temperatures and intense sunlight during the growing season1 .", "The presence of other factors that can predispose the plants to sunburn, such as water stress, nutrient deficiency, insect damage, or herbicide injury1 .", "The distribution of the symptoms on the plants, which tend to be more severe on the upper leaves and on the side facing the sun1 .", "The absence of any fungal or bacterial structures on the affected leaves1."]
