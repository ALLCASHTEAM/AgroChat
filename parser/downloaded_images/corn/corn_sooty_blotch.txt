Corn is a type of cash crop that is grown for its grain and used for food, feed, fuel and industrial products1 2. Corn coal stain is a type of fungal disease that is caused by the fungus Curvularia lunata . It is also known as Curvularia leaf spot or Curvularia blight.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of corn coal stain is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in chains on the tips of hyphae . The conidia are dispersed by wind, rain or insects. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of corn coal stain are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and rainfall. The disease is more severe in warm and humid regions, especially during the rainy season . The disease can be transmitted by infected seeds, crop residues, soil or irrigation water .
The period of disease onset for corn coal stain varies depending on the growth stage of the corn plant and the environmental conditions. The disease can infect corn plants at any stage, but it is more common and damaging in the late vegetative and reproductive stages . The disease symptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after infection. The environmental conditions required for corn coal stain are high temperature (25 to 35Г‚В°C), high humidity (\&gt;80%) and frequent rainfall (\&gt;100 mm/month) . These conditions favor the germination of conidia and the infection of corn leaves.
The overwintering method of corn coal stain is by surviving in infected seeds, crop residues or soil . The fungus can also survive on alternative hosts such as weeds or other crops.
Fungicides such as benomyl, carbendazim, mancozeb and chlorothalonil can be applied to control corn coal stain. The application dose, period and number of applications depend on the severity of the disease and the environmental conditions. The control effect can range from 50% to 90% .
Infected plant parts such as leaves, stalks and ears can be removed and destroyed to reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease.
Some antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum and Pseudomonas fluorescens can inhibit the growth and sporulation of the pathogen and enhance the resistance of the corn plants .
Crop rotation, intercropping, resistant varieties, seed treatment, sanitation, irrigation management and balanced fertilization can also help to reduce the incidence and severity of corn coal stain .
["The disease first appears as small, circular, water-soaked spots on the lower leaves of corn plants. The spots enlarge and become brown or black with yellow halos. The spots may coalesce and form irregular patches that cover large areas of the leaf surface .", "The infected leaves may curl, dry up and fall off prematurely, resulting in reduced photosynthesis and plant growth .", "The disease can also infect the stalks and ears of corn plants, causing rotting, discoloration and reduced yield and quality ."]
["The presence of dark brown or black conidia on the surface of the infected leaves, stalks or ears. The conidia are oval or cylindrical in shape and have 3 to 5 septa. They are produced in chains on the tips of hyphae .", "The presence of dark brown or black sclerotia on the surface or inside of the infected plant tissues. The sclerotia are hard, compact masses of fungal mycelium that serve as survival structures for the pathogen ."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides by altering the target site, increasing the efflux of the fungicide, degrading the fungicide or overexpressing the target gene . Type of resistance agent: The fungus can show resistance to some benzimidazole fungicides such as benomyl and carbendazim , which inhibit the fungal tubulin synthesis and disrupt the mitosis . Level of resistance: The level of resistance can vary depending on the fungal strain, the fungicide dose and the environmental conditions. Some studies have reported moderate to high levels of resistance to benomyl and carbendazim in some isolates of Curvularia lunata . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of corn coal stain is by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique that can detect and identify the fungal DNA from infected plant tissues or seeds . The PCR method can be combined with specific primers, probes or restriction enzymes to increase the specificity and sensitivity of the detection . 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus can produce several pathogenic effectors that can modulate the host defense response and facilitate the infection process. Some of these effectors include phytotoxins , such as curvularin, lunatin and hydroxycurvularin, which can inhibit plant growth, induce cell death and alter plant metabolism ; cell wall degrading enzymes , such as cellulases, pectinases and xylanases, which can degrade the plant cell wall and release nutrients for the fungus ; and oxidative stress enzymes , such as catalases, peroxidases and superoxide dismutases, which can detoxify the reactive oxygen species produced by the plant as a defense mechanism . Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus can infect a wide range of plants, including cereals, grasses, legumes, fruits and vegetables . However, the susceptibility and severity of infection may vary depending on the plant species, cultivar, genotype and physiological stage . Some plants may show resistance or tolerance to the fungus by activating their innate immunity or producing antimicrobial compounds . 
Knockout lethal genes: Some genes that are essential for the survival or virulence of the fungus can be potential targets for developing novel disease control strategies. For example, some genes that are involved in fungal development , such as conidiation, sclerotia formation, hyphal growth and appressorium formation ; fungal metabolism , such as lipid biosynthesis, nitrogen assimilation, amino acid synthesis and ergosterol biosynthesis ; and fungal stress response , such as osmotic stress, oxidative stress, heat shock and fungicide resistance .
