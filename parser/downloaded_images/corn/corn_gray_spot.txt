Corn is a type of cash crop that is grown for its grain and used for food, feed, fuel, and industrial products1 2. Corn gray spot is a type of fungal disease that is caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis1 3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in structures called conidiophores5. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental conditions, crop rotation, tillage practices, and hybrid resistance. The disease is more severe in areas with minimum tillage and corn on corn rotations. The fungus overwinters in debris on the soil surface and produces conidia that are dispersed by airborne or rain-splash mechanisms to infect new leaves3 4 5.
The period of disease onset for this disease is typically from silking to maturity in susceptible hybrids, although symptoms can occur on the lower leaves prior to tasseling in minimum tillage fields with a history of gray leaf spot2 3 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are moderate to warm temperatures (70В°-90В°F/25В°-32В°C) and high humidity or wetness (&gt;12 hours @ &gt; 90% RH or &gt;12 hours of leaf wetness) that favor infection and sporulation of the fungus2 3 4 5.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in infected corn residue on the soil surface, where it can produce conidia in the spring and initiate new infections3 4.
Fungicides can be applied to protect the foliage from infection by Cercospora zeae-maydis, the fungus that causes corn gray spot. The type of fungicide, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect depend on the product label, disease severity, weather conditions, and corn growth stage. Generally, fungicides are most effective when applied at or near tasseling (VT-R1) or earlier if disease pressure is high 1 2 3.
Cutting off the infected parts of the plant may reduce the amount of inoculum and slow down the disease spread, but it is not practical or economical for large-scale production 4.
There is no effective biological control agent for corn gray spot 4.
Crop rotation with non-host crops, such as soybean, wheat, or alfalfa, can reduce the inoculum level in the soil and lower the risk of disease 1 2 4. Tillage can also help to bury and decompose the corn residue that harbors the fungus 2. Planting resistant or tolerant hybrids can minimize yield losses due to corn gray spot 1 2 3 4.
["The disease first appears as small, necrotic spots with yellow halos on the lower leaves about two to three weeks before tasseling 5 1 4.", "The spots expand to become rectangular lesions that are restricted by leaf veins and range from 0.5 to 2 inches long and 0.125 inch wide 5 1 2 3 4.", "The lesions are gray to brown in color and have distinct parallel edges. They may appear opaque when held against the light 5 1 2 3 4.", "The lesions may coalesce and cause large areas of leaf blighting and premature senescence. The disease may progress from the lower to the upper leaves as infection cycles occur 5 1 234."]
["The fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis produces spores (conidia) that are hyaline (transparent), cylindrical, and multicellular. They are produced in clusters on dark brown stalks (conidiophores) that emerge from the stomata on both sides of the leaf lesions 514.", "The spores and conidiophores can be observed with a hand lens or a microscope on fresh or incubated leaf samples. They are more abundant on the lower leaf surface than on the upper surface 514.", "The fungus also produces a red pigment called cercosporin that accumulates in the lesions and gives them a reddish-brown color when exposed to sunlight. Cercosporin is toxic to plant cells and contributes to the necrosis of the leaf tissue 14."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the species of Cercospora that causes the maize gray spot. There are two fungal pathogens that cause this disease: Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina 1. They have different genetic and biochemical characteristics, such as the production of a toxin called cercosporin, which is involved in the pathogenicity and resistance to oxidative stress 2. The mechanism of resistance, the type of resistance agent, and the level of resistance of these fungi are not well understood, but some studies have suggested that they may involve detoxification enzymes, antioxidant systems, membrane transporters, and DNA repair mechanisms 2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a molecular technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers for Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina. This method can detect and differentiate these fungi from infected maize leaves within a few hours 2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the infection of maize leaves by Cercospora spores (conidia) that germinate and penetrate through the stomata or wounds. The fungus then grows inside the leaf tissue and produces cercosporin, which damages the plant cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disrupting membrane integrity 2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the fungal species and strain. For example, Cercospora zeae-maydis produces more cercosporin than Cercospora zeina and has a higher virulence on maize 2. The differences in infestation of different plants are related to the host specificity and genetic diversity of the Cercospora fungi 2 3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not clear, as there is little information on the bacterial causes of maize gray spot. One possible bacterium is Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, which causes bacterial leaf spot on maize 4. However, I do not have information on the knockout lethal genes or other targets of this bacterium on maize.
