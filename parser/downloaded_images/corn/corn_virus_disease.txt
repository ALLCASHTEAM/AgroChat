The type of crop of maize is a staple crop1 that is consumed as a major food source in many regions of the world, with more maize production than that of wheat and rice1. The type of disease of maize virus disease is a viral disease1 caused by synergistic infection with maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and at least one potyvirid (e.g., sugarcane mosaic virus, SCMV)2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic virus of this disease is not clear, but it is likely that the viruses are replicated inside the host cells using their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by several factors, such as the presence of insect vectors, especially leafhoppers and thrips4, the availability of alternative hosts, such as weeds and grasses3, and the movement of infected seeds and plants2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the stage of plant development, but it is generally observed that the disease symptoms appear two to four weeks after infection2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are not well understood, but some studies have suggested that high temperature and low altitude may favor the disease development2. Other factors, such as humidity, soil conditions, and rainfall may also play a role3.
The overwintering method of this disease is not well documented, but it is possible that the viruses can survive in alternative hosts or infected seeds during the off-season3.
Use of resistant varieties that have been developed through conventional breeding or genetic engineering1 2. Seed dressing with appropriate chemicals such as Apron plus or Ridomil at 2g/kg of seed3.
Roguing and destroying infected plants to prevent sporulation and spread of the virus3.Avoiding late planting and planting in poorly drained soils in areas where the disease is known to occur3.
Suppressing insect vectors using systemic pesticides sprayed on the planting furrow during maize planting1.Avoiding alternative hosts such as weeds and grasses that can harbor the virus1.
Using crop rotation and intercropping with non-host plants to reduce the disease incidence1.
["Chlorotic streaks in veins of leaf that may coalesce and form large necrotic patches1.", "Premature aging and drying of leaves, leading to reduced photosynthesis and plant growth1. Stunted plants with reduced tillering and ear formation1.", "Deformed ears with small or no kernels, resulting in low yield and quality1."]
["Presence of insect vectors, especially leafhoppers and thrips, on the leaves or stems of maize plants1. Detection of viral particles or antigens using molecular or serological techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, as most of the research has focused on the resistance of the maize plant to the virus. However, some studies have suggested that the fungus may have mechanisms of detoxification and effector secretion to overcome plant defenses1. The type and level of resistance agent used by the fungus are not clear. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not available, as the fungus is usually asymptomatic and does not produce distinctive signs on the plant. The fungus can be isolated from infected plant tissues and identified by morphological or molecular methods1. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not well understood, but it is likely that the fungus colonizes the plant tissues and interacts with the virus to enhance its infection and replication1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors used by the fungus are not known. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the susceptibility and genetic diversity of the host plants1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not relevant, as the disease is caused by a virus and a fungus, not a bacterium.
