Maize is a staple crop that is widely cultivated in many regions of the world1 2. Potassium deficiency in maize is not a disease caused by a pathogen, but a physiological disorder that affects the plant's growth and development1 3.
Since potassium deficiency is not a disease, there is no pathogenic fungus or mode of reproduction involved. Potassium deficiency can occur due to low soil potassium levels, high soil acidity, excessive leaching, root damage, drought stress, or competition with other nutrients4 5 6. It is not transmitted by any vector or agent.
Potassium deficiency symptoms in maize appear first on the lower leaves because potassium is easily moved within the plant from older to younger leaves6. Leaf symptoms are a yellowing to necrosis (tissue death) of the outer leaf margins. These symptoms begin at the leaf tip and progress down the margin toward the leaf base6. Potassium deficiency can affect maize at any stage of growth, but it is more severe during grain filling3. Potassium deficiency can occur in any environmental condition, but it is more likely to happen in light, sandy soils that have low potassium retention capacity and high leaching potential1 3. Potassium deficiency can also be aggravated by low temperatures, high humidity, and waterlogging3 7.
Since potassium deficiency is not a disease, there is no overwintering method involved.
Applying potassium fertilizer to add potassium to the soil. For example, wood ash, seaweed extract, or synthetic potassium sources can be used1 2 3.
Applying manure at the rate of 400-1000 kg/ha to improve water holding capacity and minimize leaching of nutrients from the soil4 5.
Applying lime at the rate of 0.2-0.5 t/ha if the soil pH is below 6, to increase pH and allow easy uptake of potassium by plants4.
Preventing soil erosion by planting cover crops, reducing tillage, improving drainage, using drip irrigation, applying mulch, avoiding soil compaction, and ploughing and planting perpendicular to a slope4.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of maize deficiency disease is not well understood. However, some studies have suggested that the fungus may have multiple mechanisms of resistance, such as reducing the uptake of fungicides, altering the target site of fungicides, or detoxifying the fungicides1. The type and level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide group, the fungal strain, and the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of maize deficiency disease is to use a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) device that can detect the presence of fungal antigens in plant samples2. This method is rapid, simple, and low-cost, and can be performed in the field without specialized equipment or personnel2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of maize deficiency disease involves the infection of maize plants by fungal spores that germinate and penetrate the plant tissues, causing symptoms such as leaf spots, blights, wilts, or rots3. The fungus may produce pathogenic effectors that modulate the plant immune system and facilitate the fungal colonization3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may differ among fungal species and strains, and may also depend on the host genotype and the biotic and abiotic stresses3. Some fungal pathogens may also form symbiotic associations with other microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, that enhance their virulence3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of maize deficiency disease are not well known. However, some studies have identified some genes that are involved in the bacterial pathogenesis or host resistance, such as type III secretion system (T3SS) genes, effector genes, plant defense genes, or signaling genes. These genes may be candidates for developing novel strategies to control the bacterial disease.
