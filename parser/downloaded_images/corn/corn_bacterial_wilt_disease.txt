Corn is a type of serial grain that is widely grown and consumed as a source of food, feed, fuel, and industrial products1. Bacterial wilt of corn is a type of bacterial disease that is caused by different species of bacteria depending on the region and the symptoms. Some of the most common bacterial wilt diseases of corn are Stewart's wilt, Goss's wilt, and bacterial stalk rot2.
The pathogenic bacteria that cause bacterial wilt of corn reproduce by binary fission, which is a process of asexual reproduction where one bacterial cell divides into two identical daughter cells3. Bacterial stalk rot is transmitted by soilborne bacteria (<em>Erwinia chrysanthemi</em> pv. zeae) that enter the plant through root wounds or natural openings. The disease is more prevalent in wet soils, high plant populations, and nitrogen deficient conditions4.
Stewart's wilt can occur at any growth stage of corn, but it is more severe when infection occurs early in the season. Seedling blight symptoms can appear within a week after planting, while leaf blight symptoms can appear from mid-June to late August5. Stewart's wilt requires warm (greater than 80 ВєF) and humid conditions for optimal disease development. The disease is more severe on sweet corn than field corn hybrids5.
Stewart's wilt overwinters in the body of the corn flea beetle that survives in the soil or under plant debris5.
There is no effective chemical control for bacterial wilt of corn, as fungicides are not active against bacteria. Copper-based bactericides may have some efficacy, but their use is not recommended due to phytotoxicity and environmental concerns1.
Sanitation practices such as cleaning debris from combines and other equipment between fields can help slow the spread of the disease to unaffected fields2. Cutting off the infected parts may not be feasible or practical for large-scale corn production.
There is no information available on biological control agents for this disease.
Crop rotation or tillage may help degrade infected corn debris and reduce the surviving bacteria, but neither practice will eradicate the bacterium and eliminate the risk of disease2. Planting resistant hybrids or varieties may be the best option for managing this disease, but more research is needed to identify and develop resistant germplasm3. Controlling the corn flea beetle, which is the vector of Stewart's wilt, may also help reduce disease incidence and severity4.
["The symptoms vary depending on the type of bacterium and the growth stage of corn. Some of the most common symptoms are:", "Stewart's wilt: Pale green to yellow streaks with irregular or wavy margins that parallel the leaf veins. The streaks may extend the length of the leaf and become straw-colored when they die. The lesions may also have scratch-like feeding marks of flea beetles. In seedlings, wilting and death may occur4.", "Goss's wilt: Elongated tan lesions with irregular margins that extend parallel to the veins. Dark, water-soaked spots (freckles) develop in the lesions. Shiny patches of dried bacterial ooze that appear similar to dry varnish are often present on the lesions. In some cases, systemic wilting and stalk rot may occur5.", "Bacterial stalk rot: Wilting and collapse of plants due to stalk rotting. The pith of infected stalks becomes soft and discolored, ranging from light brown to black. A foul odor may be present6."]
["The signs of this disease are the physical evidence of the bacterium itself on the plant. The signs vary depending on the type of bacterium and the method of detection. Some of the most common signs are:", "Stewart's wilt: Bacterial streaming from the cut ends of infected leaf tissue under a microscope. Yellow colonies with a mucoid appearance on a specific medium (NBY)4.", "Goss's wilt: Bacterial streaming from the cut ends of infected leaf tissue under a microscope. Orange vascular bundles in the stalk. Yellow colonies with a mucoid appearance on a specific medium (NBY)5.", "Bacterial stalk rot: Bacterial streaming from the cut ends of infected stalk tissue under a microscope. Yellow colonies with a mucoid appearance on a specific medium (NBY)6."]
Mechanism of resistance: There is no information available on the mechanism of resistance of the bacterium <em>Pantoea stewartii</em>, which causes bacterial wilt of maize (also known as Stewart's wilt). Type of resistance agent: There is no information available on the type of resistance agent that can be used against this bacterium. Level of resistance: There is no information available on the level of resistance of this bacterium to any potential agents. 
The most reliable method for diagnosing bacterial wilt of maize is to observe the bacterial streaming from the cut ends of infected leaf tissue under a microscope1. This requires a laboratory setting and specialized equipment. Another method is to culture the bacterium on a specific medium (NBY) that produces yellow colonies with a mucoid appearance1. This also requires a laboratory setting and specialized equipment. A field-based method that can help distinguish bacterial wilt from other leaf diseases is to backlight the lesions against the sun. Bacterial wilt lesions appear yellow, while other diseases such as gray leaf spot or northern corn leaf blight appear brown2. However, this method is not definitive and may vary depending on the hybrid and environmental conditions. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: There is no information available on the type and number of pathogenic effectors that are involved in the infection process of this bacterium. Differences in infestation of different plants: This bacterium has been reported to infect maize, sorghum, millet, and some grasses, but the differences in infestation of these plants are not well understood. In maize, the bacterium causes bacterial wilt or leaf blight, which reduces photosynthesis and yield1. In sorghum and millet, the bacterium causes leaf spot, which also reduces photosynthesis and yield3. In grasses, the bacterium causes wilting and necrosis4. 
Knockout lethal genes: There is no information available on knockout lethal genes that can be used as potential targets for controlling this bacterium.
