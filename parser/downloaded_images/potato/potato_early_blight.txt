Potato is a staple crop that is widely cultivated and consumed around the world1 2. Early blight of potato is a fungal disease that is caused by the pathogen Alternaria solani1 2 3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or water2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and irrigation. The disease usually develops in warm and humid conditions, and the spores can infect the plant through wounds or natural openings. The disease can also spread through infected tubers, plant debris, or soil4 2 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the cultivar, climate, and management practices. The disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common and severe in late-season crops or after flowering. The symptoms first appear on the lower or older leaves as small, brown spots that enlarge and form concentric rings1 2 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are temperatures between 15 and 30Г‚В°C, relative humidity above 90%, and frequent periods of leaf wetness. The disease is favored by warm days and cool nights, heavy dews, and frequent rains or overhead irrigation1 2 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in infected tubers, plant debris, or soil. The fungus can also persist on alternative hosts such as tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, or weeds in the same family1 2 3.
fungicides such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper can be applied to protect the foliage from infection. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect can vary depending on the weather conditions and the resistance of the potato variety1 2.
removing and destroying infected plant debris can reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease. Cutting off the infected parts of the plant may not be effective as the fungus can still infect healthy tissues1 2.
there are no commercially available biological agents for controlling early blight of potatoes2.
planting resistant potato varieties, rotating crops with non-host plants, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, spacing plants adequately for air circulation, irrigating early in the day to allow the foliage to dry quickly, and harvesting early can help reduce the risk and impact of early blight1 2.
["Small, irregular dark brown spots on the lower or oldest leaves of the plant. The spots may enlarge and take on an angular shape with concentric rings, resembling a target. The spots may coalesce and cause the entire leaf to yellow and die3 1 2.", "Dark brown to black spots on the stems of the plant3 1.", "Dark gray to purple, circular to irregular lesions with raised edges on the tubers. The tuber flesh may be brown, dry, corky, or leathery. In advanced stages, the tuber flesh may look water soaked and yellow to greenish yellow1."]
["The presence of fungal spores and mycelia on the infected plant tissues. The spores are dark brown to black and have a beak-like projection at one end. The mycelia are branched and septate3 2.", "The spores and mycelia can be observed under a microscope or with a hand lens2."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of early blight of potato is Alternaria solani1 2. The mechanism of resistance of this fungus is not well understood, but some factors that may contribute to its resistance are: the production of toxins that inhibit plant defense responses, the presence of efflux pumps that reduce the accumulation of fungicides, and the occurrence of mutations in target genes that reduce the sensitivity to fungicides. The type of resistance agent depends on the mode of action of the fungicide, such as demethylation inhibitors (DMIs), quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), or succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs). The level of resistance varies depending on the fungal isolate, the fungicide, and the environmental conditions . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of early blight of potato is the spore germination assay. This method involves placing a small amount of fungal spores on a glass slide with a drop of fungicide solution and incubating them for a few hours. Then, the spores are observed under a microscope and the percentage of germinated spores is calculated. A low percentage of germinated spores indicates a high level of resistance to the fungicide. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of early blight of potato is mainly through the production of necrotrophic effectors. These are small molecules that are secreted by the fungus and trigger cell death and tissue necrosis in the plant host. Some examples of necrotrophic effectors produced by Alternaria solani are alternariol, alternariol monomethyl ether, altenuene, and tenuazonic acid. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain, the plant genotype, and the environmental conditions . The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on their susceptibility or resistance to the fungus, which may be influenced by their genetic background, their physiological state, and their defense mechanisms. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of early blight of potato are not applicable, because early blight of potato is not caused by bacteria, but by a fungus. However, there are other diseases of potato that are caused by bacteria, such as blackleg, soft rot, and ring rot. Some potential targets for these bacterial diseases are genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, signal transduction, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance.
