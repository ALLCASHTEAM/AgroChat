Potato is a staple crop that provides food security and income for millions of people worldwide1 2. Potato late blight is caused by Phytophthora infestans, an oomycete or water mold, a fungus-like microorganism1 3.
The pathogen reproduces asexually by producing sporangia, which are sac-like structures that contain many zoospores, which are biflagellated and motile spores1 4. The pathogen can also reproduce sexually by producing oospores, which are thick-walled and resistant spores, but this requires isolates of opposite mating types (A1 and A2) to meet1. The disease is transmitted by airborne or waterborne dispersal of sporangia, which can land on potato leaves or stems and infect them directly or release zoospores that can swim on water films and infect them1 5. The disease can also be transmitted by infected tubers, which can serve as sources of inoculum for the next season or contaminate soil or water1 .
The period of disease onset for potato late blight depends on the environmental conditions and the availability of inoculum. Under optimal conditions (90-100% humidity and 54-70в„ѓ), infection can occur in as little as 2 hours and symptoms can appear in 4-5 days4 . However, under suboptimal conditions, infection and symptom development can take longer or not occur at all. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high moisture and moderate temperature. Sporulation is optimal at 12-18В°C (54-64В°C) in water-saturated or nearly saturated environments, and zoospore production is favored at temperatures below 15 В°C (59 В°C)1. Sporangia typically infect at 64-75В°C, whereas zoospores are produced and can be infective at 46-64В°C. Rainfall, dew, fog, irrigation, and high relative humidity are conducive to disease development.
The overwintering method of this disease is mainly through infected tubers, which can survive in soil, cull piles, compost heaps, or volunteer plants1 . Oospores can also overwinter in soil, but they are rare in most regions where the disease occurs1 .
There are different methods to control late blight in potato, such as using resistant varieties, applying fungicides, removing infected plants and tubers, and practicing crop rotation and sanitation.
Resistant varieties can reduce the severity and spread of the disease, but they may not be completely immune to new strains of the pathogen. Some examples of resistant varieties are Elba, Defiance, Jacqueline Lee, and Prince Hairy 1.
Fungicides can protect the plants from infection if applied before or at the first sign of the disease. They should be applied regularly and according to the label instructions. Some examples of fungicides are oxathiapiprolin, benthiavalicarb, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and copper-based products 2 3 4.
Infected plants and tubers should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent further spread of the disease. They should not be composted or left in the field or garden. Cull piles and volunteer potatoes should also be eliminated 4.
["The symptoms of late blight can appear on leaves, stems, and tubers of potato plants.", "On leaves, the symptoms are pale green, water-soaked spots that often start at the leaf tips or edges. The spots enlarge rapidly and turn dark brown to purplish black. The spots may have a bull's eye appearance with concentric rings of tissue. A white downy growth may form at the edges of the spots on the lower leaf surface 5 6 7.", "On stems, the symptoms are dark green, brown, or black water-soaked lesions that may also have white downy growth. The lesions are firm and have a rounded edge 5 6 8.", "On tubers, the symptoms are sunken and firm brown lesions that may extend several centimeters into the tuber. The flesh below the lesions may be brown, dry, leathery, or corky. The lesions may also become soft and rotten as secondary bacteria invade 9 5 6."]
["The signs of late blight are the physical evidence of the pathogen itself on the plant tissues.", "The most distinctive sign of late blight is the white downy growth that forms on the infected leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. This growth consists of sporangia (asexual spores) and sporangiophores (spore-producing structures) of Phytophthora infestans 5 6 8.", "Another sign of late blight is the presence of oospores (sexual spores) in the infected tissues. However, this sign is rare in North America because most strains of Phytophthora infestans do not produce oospores here. Oospores are thick-walled structures that can survive in the soil for several seasons 4 10."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of potato late blight is Phytophthora infestans, an oomycete or water mold that causes serious damage to potato and tomato plants1. It has developed resistance to some fungicides, such as metalaxyl and dimethomorph, through mutations in specific genes that affect the target site or the metabolic pathway of the fungicide. The mechanism of resistance varies depending on the fungicide mode of action, but it generally involves reduced sensitivity or altered binding of the fungicide to the target enzyme or protein. The level of resistance can be measured by the effective concentration (EC) or dose (ED) of the fungicide that inhibits 50% of the fungal growth or spore germination. The type of resistance agent can be either a single gene mutation or a polygenic trait that confers partial or complete resistance. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of potato late blight is the Immunostrip Test developed by Agdia Inc., which is a lateral flow device that detects the presence of P. infestans antigens in plant tissue samples. The test is simple, rapid, and reliable, and can be performed in the field or in the laboratory without specialized equipment or training. The test results are visible within 10 minutes and can be interpreted by comparing the color intensity of the test line with a reference chart. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of potato late blight involves the secretion of effectors, which are molecules that manipulate host cell processes and facilitate infection and colonization by P. infestans. P. infestans has a large and diverse repertoire of effectors, with more than 500 predicted genes encoding secreted proteins. Some of these effectors are RXLR effectors, which contain a conserved motif at their N-terminus that allows them to enter plant cells via endocytosis. Once inside the plant cell, they can target various host proteins and modulate their functions, such as suppressing plant immunity, altering transcription, interfering with signaling pathways, or manipulating hormone responses. Other effectors are CRN effectors, which also contain a conserved motif at their N-terminus that mediates their translocation into the plant nucleus. There, they can affect host gene expression, chromatin structure, or DNA repair mechanisms. The type and number of effectors vary among different strains and isolates of P. infestans, and they can also evolve rapidly to overcome host resistance genes. The differences in infestation of different plants depend on the compatibility between the effectors and their host targets, as well as the presence or absence of host recognition receptors that can trigger defense responses against P. infestans. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of potato late blight are not well known, as there is no bacterial agent that causes this disease. However, some studies have used genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to identify novel genetic determinants for virulence in P. infestans itself . These studies have revealed several genes that are essential for P. infestans growth, sporulation, infection, or pathogenicity on potato plants . Some examples are PiCesA3, which encodes a cellulose synthase required for cell wall biosynthesis and integrity; PiCdc14, which encodes a phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation and cytokinesis; PiSec22, which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vesicle trafficking and secretion; and PiRab7, which encodes a small GTPase involved in endosomal maturation and vacuolar fusion. These genes could be potential targets for developing novel strategies to control potato late blight by disrupting P. infestans functions.
