Cereal white is a common name for powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects cereal crops such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye1. Powdery mildew is caused by different species of fungi in the order Erysiphales, which are obligate biotrophs that parasitize living plant cells1 2. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungi of powdery mildew is mainly by conidia, which are asexual spores produced by specialized structures called conidiophores1 2. Conidia are dispersed by wind or rain and can infect new host plants under favorable conditions2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of powdery mildew are influenced by several factors, such as host susceptibility, environmental conditions, crop management, and pathogen variability2. Powdery mildew is mainly airborne, as conidia are carried by wind currents and can travel long distances2. However, some conidia may also be transmitted by insects or other vectors that feed on infected plants2.
The period of disease onset for powdery mildew varies depending on the crop, the pathogen, and the climate. In general, powdery mildew can infect cereal crops at any stage of growth, but it is more common and severe during the vegetative and early reproductive stages2. Powdery mildew can appear as early as two weeks after planting or as late as two weeks before harvest2. The environmental conditions required for powdery mildew are moderate to high humidity, low to moderate temperature, and low light intensity2. Powdery mildew thrives in humid but dry conditions, meaning that there is enough moisture in the air but not on the plant surface2. Temperature ranges from 15В°C to 25В°C are optimal for powdery mildew development, while temperatures above 30В°C or below 10В°C inhibit its growth2. Powdery mildew also prefers shady or cloudy conditions, as high light intensity reduces its sporulation and infection2.
The overwintering method of powdery mildew depends on the crop and the pathogen. Some powdery mildew fungi can survive on crop residues or weeds as mycelium or conidia, while others can form cleistothecia, which are sexual spores that are more resistant to adverse conditions2. Cleistothecia can germinate in spring and produce ascospores that initiate new infections2.
Fungicides can be applied to prevent or reduce the severity of powdery mildew. The type of fungicide, application dose, application period, application frequency, and control effect depend on various factors such as the crop stage, weather conditions, disease pressure, and resistance status. Some examples of fungicides that can be used against powdery mildew are triazoles, strobilurins, carboxamides, and multi-site inhibitors1 2.
Removing or destroying infected plant debris can help reduce the inoculum source for the next season. Crop rotation can also break the disease cycle and lower the risk of infection2.
Some natural enemies such as parasitic fungi, predatory mites, and insects can suppress powdery mildew populations by feeding on or infecting the fungal colonies. However, their effectiveness may vary depending on environmental conditions and availability2 3.
Planting resistant or tolerant varieties can reduce the susceptibility and damage caused by powdery mildew. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization and high plant density can also minimize the favorable conditions for disease development2 4.
["White, cottony patches (colonies) of mycelium and conidia (asexual spores) on the surface of the plant. They can occur on all aerial parts of the plant, including stems and heads, but are most conspicuous on the upper surfaces of lower leaves1 .", "The white colonies later turn dull gray-brown1.", "Infected leaves may become chlorotic (yellow), necrotic (brown), or distorted2.", "Severe infection can reduce photosynthesis, transpiration, grain filling, and yield quality and quantity2 4."]
["The presence of fungal structures such as mycelium and conidia on the plant surface is a direct sign of powdery mildew infection1 .", "The conidia are hyaline (transparent), oval to cylindrical, and produced in chains2.", "The mycelium is superficial, branched, septate (divided by cross-walls), and hyaline2.", "In some cases, cleistothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) may be formed on the infected plant tissue. They are dark brown to black, spherical, and contain ascospores (sexual spores)2."]
Plasma membrane-localized receptor proteins: These are proteins that recognize specific molecules or patterns associated with the fungal pathogen and trigger defense responses in the plant cell. For example, the wheat gene Pm3 encodes a receptor-like protein that confers resistance to powdery mildew by recognizing fungal avirulence effectors1<strong>.</strong>Intracellular immune receptors: These are proteins that belong to the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family and detect the presence or activity of fungal effectors inside the plant cell. For example, the wheat gene Lr67 encodes an NLR protein that confers durable, partial resistance to multiple fungal pathogens, including powdery mildew, by activating a hypersensitive cell death response2 1.Quantitative disease resistance: This is a type of resistance that is controlled by multiple genes with small effects and is effective against a broad range of pathogens and environmental conditions. For example, the wheat gene Yr36 encodes a kinase protein that confers partial resistance to stripe rust and powdery mildew by enhancing high-temperature adult-plant resistance1В 3<strong>.</strong>
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of cereal white disease is:Microscopic examination: This method involves collecting plant samples with suspected powdery mildew infection and observing them under a microscope. The presence of fungal structures such as mycelium and conidia on the plant surface can confirm the diagnosis of powdery mildew4.Molecular detection: This method involves extracting DNA from plant samples with suspected powdery mildew infection and performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other molecular techniques to amplify and detect specific DNA sequences of the fungal pathogen. This method can provide more accurate and sensitive identification of powdery mildew species and strains4.
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of cereal white disease is:The fungal pathogen lands on the plant surface and germinates to produce a germ tube that grows towards a stomata (pore) on the leaf epidermis4.The germ tube forms an appressorium (infection structure) that penetrates the cuticle and cell wall of the epidermal cell through mechanical pressure and enzymatic degradation4.The appressorium produces a haustorium (feeding structure) that invades the epidermal cell and establishes a biotrophic interaction with the plant cell. The haustorium extracts nutrients from the plant cell and secretes effectors that manipulate plant defense responses4.The fungus produces superficial mycelium that spreads over the leaf surface and forms conidiophores (spore-bearing structures) that produce conidia (asexual spores). The conidia are dispersed by wind or rain to infect new plant tissues or hosts4.
The type and number of pathogenic effectors vary depending on the fungal species and strain. Some examples of effectors involved in powdery mildew infection are:Avirulence effectors: These are effectors that are recognized by specific plant resistance proteins and trigger defense responses that limit fungal growth. For example, AvrPm3a2/f2 is an avirulence effector from Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt), the causal agent of wheat powdery mildew, that is recognized by the wheat resistance protein Pm3a/f1.Virulence effectors: These are effectors that enhance fungal virulence by suppressing plant defense responses or facilitating nutrient acquisition. For example, Ecp6 is a virulence effector from Bgt that inhibits chitin-triggered immunity by binding to chitin oligosaccharides released from fungal cell walls4.
