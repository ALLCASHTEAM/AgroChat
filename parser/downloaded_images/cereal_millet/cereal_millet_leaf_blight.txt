Cereal leaf blight is a disease that affects cereal crops such as wheat, barley, oats, millet, sorghum, triticale, and rye1. Cereal crops are staple food crops that provide carbohydrates and proteins for human consumption and animal feed2. Cereal leaf blight is a fungal disease caused by various species of the genus Alternaria3 1. Alternaria is a common and widespread group of fungi that can infect many different plant species3.
The pathogenic fungi of cereal leaf blight reproduce by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or water3 1. Conidia are usually dark brown or black and have a beak-like shape3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of cereal leaf blight depend on the environmental conditions, the host plant, and the fungal species involved3 4. Generally, the disease is more severe in warm and humid climates, where conidia can germinate and infect the leaves more easily3. The disease can also spread through infected seeds, crop residues, or irrigation water5. The disease usually starts from the lower leaves and moves upward to the upper leaves and heads5.
The period of disease onset for cereal leaf blight varies depending on the fungal species, the host plant, and the environmental factors5. Some species of Alternaria can infect the plants at any stage of growth, while others are more likely to infect during flowering or grain filling stages5. The disease can develop rapidly within a few days or weeks after infection5. The environmental conditions required for cereal leaf blight are mainly warm temperatures (between 20Г‚В°C and 30Г‚В°C) and high humidity (above 80%)5. The disease can also be favored by poor drainage, excessive nitrogen fertilization, dense planting, lack of crop rotation, or susceptible varieties5.
The overwintering method of cereal leaf blight is through survival structures such as sclerotia or chlamydospores that can persist in the soil or crop residues for several years5. The fungi can also overwinter on alternative hosts such as weeds or volunteer plants5.
Fungicides such as azoxystrobin, propiconazole, tebuconazole, and pyraclostrobin can be applied to reduce the severity and spread of the disease1 2. The application dose, period, frequency, and effect may vary depending on the product label, crop stage, disease pressure, and environmental conditions2.
Removing infected plant debris and crop residues can help reduce the inoculum source and prevent the disease from overwintering1 2. Burning or burying the infected material may also be effective2.
Some antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Trichoderma harzianum have been reported to inhibit the growth and sporulation of Alternaria triticina , the causal agent of cereal leaf blight3 4. These biocontrol agents can be applied as seed treatments or foliar sprays3 4.
Planting resistant or tolerant varieties, rotating crops with non-host plants, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization, maintaining optimal plant density, and irrigating at appropriate times can help reduce the susceptibility and incidence of the disease1 2 4.
["Small brown spots with yellow halos on the leaves, which enlarge and coalesce to form irregular lesions1 2.", "Premature defoliation of infected leaves, resulting in reduced photosynthesis and grain filling1 2.", "Reduced yield and quality of the grains due to shriveled kernels and lower test weight1 2."]
["Dark brown to black conidia (spores) of Alternaria triticina on the surface of the lesions, which can be observed under a microscope or with a hand lens1 3.", "Black streaks or bands on the conidia, which are characteristic of Alternaria species1 3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the type of fungus and the host plant. For example, Alternaria triticina is a fungal plant pathogen that causes leaf blight on wheat1. It has been reported that this fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as strobilurins, by mutations in the cytochrome b gene. The resistance agent is a point mutation that alters the binding site of the fungicide. The level of resistance can vary depending on the frequency and distribution of the mutation in the fungal population. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to use a molecular diagnostic tool such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). These methods can detect the presence and identity of the fungal DNA in plant samples within hours. They are also sensitive, specific, and cost-effective. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease involves the interaction between fungal effectors and plant receptors. Fungal effectors are molecules that are secreted by the fungus to manipulate the host plant's defense and metabolism. Plant receptors are proteins that recognize the effectors and trigger a response, such as resistance or susceptibility. The type and number of pathogenic effectors can vary depending on the fungal species and strain. For example, Magnaporthe oryzae, which causes rice blast disease, has over 500 predicted effectors, but only a few have been functionally characterized. Differences in infestation of different plants can depend on the compatibility between fungal effectors and plant receptors. For example, some wheat cultivars have a receptor protein called Lr34 that confers durable resistance to leaf rust and leaf blight by recognizing a fungal effector called AvrLr34. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are genes that are essential for bacterial survival or virulence. For example, Xanthomonas transluscens pv. undulosa is a bacterial plant pathogen that causes leaf streak and black chaff in cereals2 3. It has been shown that knocking out some genes involved in bacterial motility, secretion systems, or cell wall synthesis can reduce its ability to infect plants or cause symptoms .
