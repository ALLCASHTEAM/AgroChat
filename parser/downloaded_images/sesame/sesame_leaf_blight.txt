Sesame (Sesamum indicum) is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible seeds and oil1. Sesame leaf blight is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria sesami, a seed-borne pathogen2 3.
The mode of reproduction of Alternaria sesami is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in chains on the tips of hyphae4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of sesame leaf blight are influenced by various environmental factors such as temperature, light, humidity, rainfall, and wind. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions, and the conidia are dispersed by wind and rain splash5 .
The period of disease onset for sesame leaf blight varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the cultivar. The disease can attack seedlings, stems, leaves, and pods of sesame plants at any stage of growth, but it is more common during the flowering and pod-filling stages3 . The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm (25-30Г‚В°C) and humid (80-90% relative humidity) conditions that favor the germination of conidia and the infection of host tissues3 . The disease is also favored by poor drainage, excess rainfall, high plant density, and weed competition1 .
The overwintering method of sesame leaf blight is by surviving on infected seeds and plant debris in the soil3 . The pathogen can also survive on alternative hosts such as weeds and other crops.
The use of fungicides such as mancozeb, chlorothalonil, or copper oxychloride can reduce the severity of the disease and increase the yield of sesame1. However, chemical control is not very effective and may pose environmental and health risks2. The use of antibiotics such as streptomycin can also control bacterial leaf spot, but this may lead to resistance development and residue problems3.
The removal of infected plant parts and the destruction of crop residues can reduce the inoculum sources and prevent the spread of the disease2. However, this method is labor-intensive and may not be feasible for large-scale production.
The use of antagonistic microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, or Trichoderma harzianum can suppress the growth and infection of Alternaria sesami by producing antibiotics, enzymes, or volatile compounds2 4. However, biological control is not very consistent and may be affected by environmental factors.
The use of disease-free seeds, resistant varieties, crop rotation, intercropping, proper spacing, weed management, and timely irrigation can enhance the resistance of sesame plants and reduce the disease incidence and severity2 4 5. This method is considered the most effective, environment-friendly, and cheap method of disease control2.
["The infected seeds become discolored and shriveled and fail to germinate or produce weak seedlings2.", "The infected seedlings show water-soaked lesions on the stem near the soil line and collapse within a few days2.", "The infected stems show dark brown to black lesions that girdle the stem and cause wilting and death of the plant2.", "The infected leaves show circular to irregular brown spots with concentric rings that coalesce to form large necrotic areas. The spots may have yellow halos or reddish margins. The infected leaves may curl, dry up, and fall off prematurely2 4.", "The infected pods show brown spots that enlarge and cover the entire pod surface. The pods may crack open and drop the seeds or produce shriveled and discolored seeds2 4."]
["The presence of dark brown to black conidia (spores) of Alternaria sesami on the surface of infected plant parts. The conidia are oval to oblong in shape and have transverse and longitudinal septa. They are produced in chains on short conidiophores that emerge from the stomata or through the epidermis2 4.", "The presence of whitish to grayish mycelium (fungal threads) of Alternaria sesami on the surface or inside the infected plant parts. The mycelium is septate and branched and may form sclerotia (hardened masses) in some cases2 4."]
Resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: Mechanism of resistance: The resistance of sesame plants to Alternaria sesami is mainly based on the hypersensitive response (HR), which is a rapid cell death at the site of infection that prevents the spread of the pathogen1. The HR is mediated by the recognition of pathogen effectors by plant resistance (R) genes2. Type of resistance agent: The resistance agent for sesame leaf blight is the R gene that encodes a protein that can detect the presence of Alternaria sesami and trigger the HR. Several R genes have been identified in sesame using QTL mapping and genome-wide association analysis, such as SIN_1019016, which is located on chromosome 10 and shows higher expression in resistant cultivars2. Level of resistance: The level of resistance to sesame leaf blight varies depending on the genotype, environment, and pathogen isolate. Some cultivars show complete resistance to certain isolates, while others show partial or no resistance. The resistance level can also be affected by temperature, humidity, and plant growth stage1 3. 
Quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: One possible quick test method for Alternaria sesami is to use a specific DNA probe or PCR primer that can hybridize with the genomic DNA of the fungus and produce a detectable signal. This method can be performed on infected plant tissues or seeds and can provide a rapid and accurate diagnosis of the disease4. Another possible quick test method for Alternaria sesami is to use a serological assay such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) that can detect the presence of fungal antigens or antibodies in plant sap or seed extracts. This method can also provide a fast and reliable diagnosis of the disease4. 
Mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease: Type and number of pathogenic effectors: Pathogenic effectors are molecules secreted by pathogens that can manipulate host defenses or physiology. Alternaria sesami produces several types of effectors, such as toxins, enzymes, and small secreted proteins (SSPs). The exact number and function of these effectors are not well known, but some examples include alternariol (a toxin that inhibits photosynthesis), endopolygalacturonase (an enzyme that degrades cell wall pectin), and Alt a 1 (an SSP that induces host cell death) . Differences in infestation of different plants: Alternaria sesami can infect various plants belonging to different families, such as Pedaliaceae (sesame), Asteraceae (sunflower), Brassicaceae (mustard), Fabaceae (soybean), Malvaceae (cotton), Solanaceae (tomato), etc.. However, the degree and pattern of infestation may vary depending on the host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, and environmental conditions. For example, sesame is more susceptible to Alternaria sesami than sunflower, and leaf spot symptoms are more common on sesame than on other hosts.
