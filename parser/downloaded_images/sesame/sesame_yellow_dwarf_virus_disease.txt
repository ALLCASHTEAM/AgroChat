Sesame is a cash crop that is cultivated for its edible seeds and oil1. Sesame yellow dwarf virus disease is a viral disease that is caused by different viruses belonging to the genus Polerovirus2.
The pathogenic fungus of sesame yellow dwarf virus disease is not applicable, since the disease is caused by viruses, not fungi. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of sesame yellow dwarf virus disease are influenced by the presence and activity of aphid vectors that can acquire and transmit the viruses from infected to healthy plants2. The disease can also be transmitted through infected seeds2.
The period of disease onset for sesame yellow dwarf virus disease may vary depending on the time of infection, the virus strain, and the environmental conditions. Generally, the symptoms appear more severe when the plants are infected at early stages of growth2. The symptoms include stunting, yellowing, leaf curling, and reduced seed production2. The environmental conditions required for sesame yellow dwarf virus disease are favorable for aphid population growth and virus replication. These include warm temperatures, high humidity, and moderate rainfall2. The disease is more prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions2.
The overwintering method of sesame yellow dwarf virus disease is mainly through infected seeds that can serve as sources of inoculum for the next season2. The viruses can also survive in alternative hosts or weeds that can harbor aphids during winter2.
Chemical control involves the use of insecticides to reduce the population of aphid vectors that transmit the viruses1 2.
Physical measures include cutting off the infected parts of the plants or removing the infected plants entirely to prevent further spread of the disease3.
Biological control involves the use of natural enemies of aphids, such as parasitoids, predators, or pathogens2.
Agricultural control involves the use of virus-free and nematode-resistant seeds or rootstocks, crop rotation, weed management, and sowing date adjustment to avoid peak aphid activity2 3 4.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of sesame yellow dwarf virus disease is not applicable, since the disease is caused by viruses, not fungi. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of sesame yellow dwarf virus disease is not available, since the disease is caused by viruses, not fungi. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of sesame yellow dwarf virus disease is also not applicable, since the disease is caused by viruses, not fungi. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of sesame yellow dwarf virus disease are not clear, since the disease is caused by viruses, not bacteria.
