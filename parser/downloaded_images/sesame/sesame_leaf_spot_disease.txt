Sesame is a cash crop that is grown for its oil-rich seeds1. Leaf spot disease of sesame can be caused by different pathogens, such as bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas syringae pv. sesami) or fungi (e.g., Cercospora sesami)2 3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus Cercospora sesami is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in structures called conidiomata1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of leaf spot disease depend on the pathogen involved. For bacterial pathogens, the disease is usually seedborne and can be spread by rain splash, irrigation water, insects, or contaminated tools3. For fungal pathogens, the disease is usually airborne and can be spread by wind or rain4.
The period of disease onset for leaf spot disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the pathogen involved. For bacterial pathogens, the disease can occur at any stage of plant growth, but is more severe during warm and humid weather3. For fungal pathogens, the disease usually occurs during the later stages of plant growth, when the leaves are older and more susceptible4. The environmental conditions required for the disease also vary depending on the pathogen involved. For bacterial pathogens, the disease favors temperatures between 25Г‚В°C and 30Г‚В°C and high humidity3. For fungal pathogens, the disease favors temperatures between 20Г‚В°C and 30Г‚В°C and wet conditions4.
The overwintering method of the disease depends on the pathogen involved. For bacterial pathogens, the disease can survive on infected seeds or plant debris3. For fungal pathogens, the disease can survive on infected seeds, plant debris, or weeds4.
Spraying fungicides at the first onset of disease before flowering, you can use 30% compound carbendazim suspension 1000 times or 70% thiophanate-methyl wettable powder 800 times + 75% chlorothalonil wettable powder 1000 times, 50% benomyl wettable powder 1500 times, 45% triadimefon - fumonisin wettable powder 1000 times, 30% alkaline copper sulfate suspension 500 times, 40% triadimefon - polymyxin wettable powder 1000 times, 47% Chunlei - copper oxychloride wettable powder 800 times, 30% copper oxychloride suspension 600 times, 12% copper turpentine emulsion 600 times, etc. Spraying control, a total of 3 times, every 7 ~ 15 days 1 time, before the dense after the sparse, alternating or mixed application, spraying evenly and spraying enough.
Select disease-free seeds, soak the seeds in 53 в„ѓ ~ 55 в„ѓ warm water for 10 minutes, kill the mycelium on the seeds, dry and sow. Also available seed mixing disinfection method, that is, with 70% thiophanate + 75% chlorothalonil wettable powder mix, according to the seed weight of 0.3% ~ 0.5% powder mix, sealed 72 hours after sowing.
Select disease-resistant varieties that are mildly susceptible to leaf spot, have full, well-colored grains, high thousand-grain weights, strong resistance, and high yields
Crop rotation is practiced, the field is cleaned in a timely manner after harvest, disease residues are removed, and the land is deep-turned at the right time.
["There are two common symptoms of leaf disease, a leaf spot is mostly 1~3 mm in diameter round spots, gray-white in the middle, surrounded by purple-brown, gray mold on the back of the spot. Severe occurrences, multiple spots can be fused into large plaques, easy to dry and rupture, often causing defoliation. Another leaf spot for snake eye-like spots, the middle of a gray-white dots, like an eyeball, that is, "snake eye spot", surrounded by light gray, peripheral yellow-brown, round to indeterminate, cross diameter of 3 ~ 10 mm. Stem onset spots brown, irregular shape, high humidity when the disease dark gray mold."]
["Leaf damage, spots round, subround or polygonal, the edge is black-brown, the middle is gray-brown, the back of the spot grows a layer of black mold, the central rupture, in severe cases, a leaf can grow more than a dozen spots. The spots on the stems are light brown, irregularly shaped, with distinct margins. The lesions on the capsule are round, with black-brown margins."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of sesame leaf spot disease, which is mainly caused by Cercospora sesami1, is not well studied. However, some general mechanisms of resistance to fungicides in phytopathogenic fungi are known. These include target site modification, such as mutations in the cytochrome b gene that confer resistance to QoI fungicides2 3, efflux pumps that reduce the intracellular concentration of fungicides4, and detoxification enzymes that degrade or modify fungicides4. The type and level of resistance may depend on the specific fungicide used and the frequency and intensity of its application4. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of sesame leaf spot disease is not available. However, some molecular methods have been developed for detection and identification of resistant genotypes of other fungi, such as PCR-based assays, DNA sequencing, and molecular markers5. These methods may be adapted or modified for Cercospora sesami if the genetic basis of its resistance is known. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of sesame leaf spot disease is also not well understood. However, some general factors that influence the infection process of phytopathogenic fungi are spore germination, appressorium formation, penetration, colonization, and sporulation5. These factors may be affected by environmental conditions, host resistance, and fungal virulence5. The type and number of pathogenic effectors, which are molecules that manipulate host defenses and facilitate infection5, may vary among different fungal species and strains. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on their susceptibility, anatomy, and physiology5. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of sesame leaf spot disease are not clear. However, some general strategies for finding potential targets are screening for essential genes that are required for fungal survival or pathogenicity4, identifying fungal-specific genes that are absent in plants or animals4, and exploiting hostГўв‚¬вЂњpathogen interactions that reveal fungal vulnerabilities4. These strategies may require genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolomic analyses of the fungus and its host4.
