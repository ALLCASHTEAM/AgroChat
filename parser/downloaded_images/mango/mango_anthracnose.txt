According to , mango is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Anacardiaceae. It is a tropical and subtropical fruit that is widely consumed and valued for its flavor, aroma, and nutritional benefits. According to 1, mango Anthracnose is a fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. It is the most important and destructive disease of mango worldwide, affecting both pre-harvest and post-harvest quality of the fruit.
According to 1, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides reproduces by producing asexual spores called conidia. The conidia are formed in structures called acervuli that are visible as black dots on the infected plant tissues. The conidia are dispersed by wind, rain, insects, or human activities. According to 2, mango Anthracnose is favored by warm and humid conditions, especially during flowering and fruit development. The fungus infects the flowers, leaves, twigs, and fruits of mango, causing various symptoms such as necrotic spots, blights, cankers, and rots. The infection can occur at any stage of fruit development, but it is more severe on young fruits. The fungus can survive on infected plant debris or latent infections on symptomless fruits. The disease can spread rapidly within and between orchards by wind-blown conidia or contaminated tools, equipment, or packing materials.
According to 1, mango Anthracnose can occur at any time of the year, but it is more prevalent during the rainy season or when there is frequent irrigation or dew formation. The disease can appear as early as the flowering stage or as late as the post-harvest stage. The incubation period (the time between infection and symptom expression) can vary from a few days to several weeks depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the host. According to 1, mango Anthracnose requires warm (20Гўв‚¬вЂњ30Г‚В°C) and humid (\&gt;80% relative humidity) conditions for infection and sporulation. The disease is more severe in areas with high rainfall (\&gt;1000 mm/year) or frequent irrigation or dew formation. The disease is less severe in areas with dry and hot climates or where there is good air circulation and sunlight penetration in the canopy.
According to 1, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides can overwinter on infected plant debris or latent infections on symptomless fruits. The fungus can also survive in soil or on alternative hosts such as weeds or other crops.
Fungicides containing copper, mancozeb, propiconazole, azoxystrobin, or pyraclostrobin can be used to prevent or reduce anthracnose infection1 2 3. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect depend on the product label and the local conditions. Generally, fungicides should be applied at the onset of flowering and repeated at regular intervals until one or two weeks before harvest1 2. Fungicides should be sprayed thoroughly to cover all plant parts, especially the flowers and fruits1 2. Fungicides should be rotated with different modes of action to avoid resistance development by the fungus1 2.
Infected plant parts, such as leaves, twigs, and fruits, should be removed and destroyed to reduce the source of inoculum1 2. Pruning of dense canopies can improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the trees1 2. Avoid overhead irrigation or wetting of foliage during flowering and fruiting seasons1 2.
There are some reports of biological agents, such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, or Pseudomonas fluorescens, that can suppress anthracnose infection by competing with or antagonizing the fungus4. However, their efficacy and availability may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the application methods4.
Resistant or tolerant cultivars can be planted to reduce the severity of anthracnose1 2. Some examples of resistant cultivars are 'Carabao', 'Manila', 'Pico', 'Sensation', and 'Tommy Atkins'1 2. Cultural practices, such as crop rotation, intercropping, mulching, and fertilization, can enhance the health and vigor of the plants and make them less susceptible to anthracnose1 2.
["On leaves: Small brown to black spots or lesions appear on young leaves, which may coalesce and cause leaf distortion or defoliation1 2.", "On flowers: Brown to black spots or blights appear on flower panicles, which may cause flower abortion or failure of fruit set1 2.", "On fruits: Dark brown to black spots or lesions appear on young fruits, which may enlarge and form sunken areas with pinkish spore masses in wet conditions1 2. On mature fruits, the lesions may cause dark blemishes or cracks on the fruit skin, affecting the appearance and quality of the fruits1 2."]
["On infected plant tissues: The fungus produces spores (conidia) in acervuli (small cushion-like structures) that are visible as pinkish orange masses on the surface of the lesions in wet conditions1 2. The spores are oval to cylindrical in shape and have one or two septa (cross-walls) dividing them into cells4.", "On culture media: The fungus can be isolated from infected plant tissues and grown on artificial culture media, such as potato dextrose agar (PDA) or oatmeal agar (OA)4. The fungus produces white to grayish mycelium (fungal threads) that may turn orange to salmon with age[4. The fungus also produces spores (conidia) in acervuli that are visible as black dots on the surface of the mycelium[4. The spores are oval to cylindrical in shape and have one or two septa dividing them into cells[4. The fungus may also produce sexual spores (ascospores) in perithecia (flask-shaped structures) that are embedded in black stromata (hardened masses of mycelium) on old cultures or plant debris[4. The ascospores are hyaline (transparent), fusiform (spindle-shaped), and have three septa dividing them into four cells[4."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of mango anthracnose is Colletotrichum gloeosporioides1 2. This fungus can develop resistance to some fungicides, such as benzimidazoles and strobilurins2. The mechanism of resistance involves mutations in the genes encoding for the target proteins of the fungicides, such as tubulin and cytochrome b2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal strain, the fungicide dose and the environmental conditions2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of mango anthracnose is polymerase chain reaction (PCR)2. This method can detect the presence and identity of the fungus by amplifying its DNA from infected plant tissues2. PCR can be performed using specific primers that target the fungal genes or regions that are unique to C. gloeosporioides2. PCR can also be combined with other techniques, such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or DNA sequencing, to differentiate C. gloeosporioides from other related fungi2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of mango anthracnose involves the production and release of spores by the fungus1 2. The spores are dispersed by wind, rain or insects to healthy plant parts, such as leaves, flowers or fruits1 2. The spores germinate and penetrate the plant tissues through natural openings or wounds1 2. The fungus then grows and colonizes the plant tissues, causing symptoms such as black spots, lesions, cracks or rotting1 2. The fungus can also produce pathogenic effectors, which are molecules that modulate the plant defense responses and facilitate infection2. Some examples of pathogenic effectors are cutinases, which degrade the plant cuticle; cellulases, which degrade the plant cell wall; and glucanases, which degrade fungal cell wall components to avoid recognition by plant receptors2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may depend on the fungal strain, the plant cultivar and the environmental conditions2. The infestation of different plants by C. gloeosporioides may differ in terms of host range, symptom expression and disease severity1 2. C. gloeosporioides can infect many other fruits besides mango, such as guava, pomegranate, citrus and papaya1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of mango anthracnose are not clear, as there is no evidence that bacteria are involved in this disease1 3 4 2. Mango anthracnose is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium1 3 4 2. Therefore, I do not have any information on this item.
