Sunflower is a cash crop that is grown for its oil, seeds and ornamental value1 2. Sunflower black spot is a fungal disease that can be caused by different species of fungi, such as <em>Phoma, Alternaria </em>and <em>Septoria</em>3 1 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungi of sunflower black spot depends on the species. For example, <em>Phoma</em> produces <em>pycnidia</em>, which are flask-shaped structures that contain spores1. <em>Alternaria</em> produces <em>conidia</em>, which are asexual spores that are released into the air3. <em>Septoria</em> also produces <em>pycnidia</em>, but they are smaller and more numerous than those of <em>Phoma</em>1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of sunflower black spot also depends on the species of fungi. For example, <em>Phoma</em> is a soilborne fungus that can infect sunflowers through wounds or root injuries1. It can also be spread by wind and insects2. <em>Alternaria</em> is an airborne fungus that can infect sunflowers through splashing water or dew3. It can also be carried by seeds or plant debris3. <em>Septoria</em> is a residue-borne fungus that can infect sunflowers through rain or irrigation water1. It can also survive on infected plant material from the previous season1.
The period of disease onset for sunflower black spots varies depending on the species of fungi and the environmental conditions. For example, Phoma can infect sunflowers at any stage of growth, but symptoms usually appear after flowering or during seed development1. <em>Alternaria</em> can infect sunflowers at any stage of growth, but symptoms usually appear during late summer or early fall3. <em>Septoria </em>can infect sunflowers at any stage of growth, but symptoms usually appear towards the end of the growing season1. The environmental conditions required for sunflower black spots are different for each species of fungi. For example, Phoma prefers warm and wet weather and high soil moisture1. Alternaria prefers warm and humid weather and frequent rains3. Septoria prefers moderately warm temperatures and frequent rains1.
The overwintering method of sunflower black spot depends on the species of fungi. For example, Phoma can survive in the soil or on infected plant debris for several years1. Alternaria can survive on seeds or infected plant debris for one year or more3. Septoria can survive on infected plant debris for one year or more1.
Fungicides can be used to prevent or reduce the disease, but they should be applied early, before outbreaks or at the first sign of spots. Fungicides should be chosen based on the type of fungus and the label instructions. Some examples of fungicides that can control sunflower black spot are azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, propiconazole and tebuconazole1 2.
Infected plant debris should be removed and buried or burned to prevent the fungus from overwintering or spreading. Infected leaves or stems should be pruned and disposed of properly. Tools should be disinfected after pruning each leaf or stem3 1 4.
There are no known biological agents that can effectively control sunflower black spot disease.
Crop rotation can reduce the risk of infection by breaking the disease cycle. Sunflowers should not be planted in the same field for two consecutive years. Planting resistant hybrids can also help to avoid or minimize the disease. Avoiding high-nitrogen fertilizers and excessive irrigation can also reduce the disease severity3 1 4.
["Dark circular spots on the leaves, sometimes with yellow halos or borders. The spots may coalesce and cause the leaves to wither and die3 4.", "Dark streaks, flecks or diamond-shaped spots on the stems or petioles. The spots may girdle the stem and cause it to break3 4.", "Dark spots on the back of the head, making the plant look wilted3 4."]
["Small black fungal structures (<em>pycnidia</em>) in or around the spots, visible with a hand lens. Pycnidia are flask-shaped structures that contain spores3 1.", "Small brown fungal structures (<em>conidia</em>) in or around the spots, visible with a hand lens. Conidia are asexual spores that are released into the air3.", "Small orange fungal structures (<em>aecia</em>) on the underside of the leaves or cotyledons, opposite to yellow to orange bumps (<em>pycnia</em>) on the top side. Aecia are cup-shaped structures that contain spores1."]
The mechanism of resistance: The fungus may have genetic or biochemical mechanisms that allow it to overcome the host defense or the fungicide action. For example, the fungus may have mutations that alter the target site of the fungicide, or enzymes that degrade or detoxify the fungicide1. The type of resistance agent: The fungus may have different levels of resistance to different types of fungicides, depending on their mode of action and specificity. For example, the fungus may be more resistant to fungicides that inhibit a single metabolic pathway than to fungicides that affect multiple processes1. The level of resistance: The fungus may have different degrees of resistance, ranging from sensitivity to tolerance to insensitivity. The level of resistance may depend on the dose and frequency of fungicide application, the environmental conditions, and the genetic diversity of the fungal population1. 
Microscopic examination: The fungus can be identified by its morphological characteristics, such as the shape, size and color of its spores and structures. A sample of infected plant tissue can be mounted on a slide and observed under a microscope2 3. Molecular detection: The fungus can be detected by its DNA or RNA sequences, using techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). A sample of infected plant tissue can be extracted for nucleic acids and amplified with specific primers or probes. Serological detection: The fungus can be detected by its antigens or proteins, using techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), or lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). A sample of infected plant tissue can be tested with specific antibodies or antigens. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus may produce various molecules that can manipulate the host cell functions, such as toxins, enzymes, elicitors, suppressors, or effectors. These molecules may interfere with the host defense, induce cell death, modulate signaling pathways, or alter gene expression . The differences in infestation of different plants:The fungus may have different levels of virulence or aggressiveness on different plant species or varieties, depending on their compatibility or susceptibility. The plant may have different levels of resistance or tolerance to the fungus, depending on their genetic or physiological traits .
