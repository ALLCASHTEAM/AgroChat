Sunflower is a cash crop that is grown for its oil and seeds1 2. Bacterial leaf spot is a bacterial disease that is caused by <em>Pseudomonas syringae pv. helianthi</em>1 and <em>Pseudomonas syringae pv. tagetis</em> 3.
<em>Pseudomonas syringae pv. helianthi</em> is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that does not produce spores3. It reproduces by binary fission, which is a type of asexual reproduction where one cell divides into two identical cells. Bacterial leaf spot is transmitted by splashing rain and high winds that spread the soilborne bacteria onto the leaves4 5. It can also infect plants through open stomates or wounds created by hail, sandblasting, or other forms of mechanical damage1.
The period of disease onset for bacterial leaf spot varies depending on the environmental conditions and the cultivar of sunflower. Generally, the disease can appear anytime during the growing season, but it is more common during periods of cool weather5. The symptoms begin on foliage as small necrotic spots of varying size and shape, which later become water-soaked and angular1. The environmental conditions required for bacterial leaf spot are high levels of humidity or rainfall, which favor the survival and dispersal of the bacteria1. The disease can also be influenced by the temperature, as it is more prevalent in cool climates5.
The overwintering method of bacterial leaf spot is not well understood, but it is likely that the bacteria can survive on plant residues in the soil or on infected seeds1 2.
Chemical control: Applying a copper-based fungicide at the first sign of symptoms or as a preventive measure1 2. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product label and the environmental conditions.
Physical measures: Removing and destroying the infected plant parts or the entire plants if severely infected3. This can reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease.
Biological control: There is no known biological control agent for this disease.
Agricultural control: Practicing crop rotation every two years with non-host crops1 4. This can reduce the soilborne inoculum and break the disease cycle. Also, using certified disease-free seeds2 and avoiding overhead irrigation1. These can prevent the introduction and dissemination of the bacteria.
["Necrotic spots of varying size and shape on the leaves, which may be surrounded by chlorotic halos1 3. The spots are water-soaked and angular at first, and later become dry and darkened1.", "Coalescing lesions that cause tissues to dry, die and fall out, often in linear strips between leaf veins1.", "Systemic infection that spreads along veins, but without the chlorotic bleaching of plant tissues1.", "Foliar death and defoliation, which can reduce photosynthesis and yield potential1."]
["There are no visible signs of the pathogen itself on the plant, as it is a microscopic bacterium that lives inside the plant tissues3.", "The only way to confirm the presence of the pathogen is by using laboratory techniques such as isolation, culturing, biochemical tests, or molecular methods3."]
The presence of a copper resistance gene (copA) that encodes a copper-transporting ATPase, which can pump out excess copper from the cell1. The production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) that can protect the cell from copper toxicity and oxidative stress2. The expression of efflux pumps that can export antibiotics and other toxic compounds from the cell2. The acquisition of plasmids or transposons that can carry resistance genes or other adaptive traits2. 
PCR-based assay that can amplify a specific DNA fragment from the bacterium using specific primers3 4 5. This method can detect the bacterium from plant samples or pure cultures, and can also differentiate different strains or populations of the bacterium. 
The injection of type III effectors into the plant cells using a specialized secretion system, which can modulate plant defense responses and promote bacterial colonization2. The production of phytotoxins such as syringomycin and syringopeptin, which can cause necrosis and chlorosis on plant tissues and increase bacterial virulence2. The adaptation to different environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, osmolarity, and nutrient availability, which can affect bacterial growth and survival2. 
Knockout lethal genes that are essential for bacterial viability or pathogenicity, such as genes involved in cell wall synthesis, DNA replication, protein synthesis, or secretion systems2. Host susceptibility genes that are required for bacterial infection or disease development, such as genes involved in signal transduction, transcription regulation, or defense responses2.
