Peach trees are a type of horticultural crop1, which means they are grown for their fruits and ornamental value. Iron deficiency is not a disease caused by a pathogen, but a physiological disorder2 that results from the inability of the plant to absorb enough iron from the soil.
Since iron deficiency is not a disease, there is no pathogenic fungus involved and no mode of reproduction to consider. Iron deficiency can affect peach trees regardless of their mode of transmission, as it depends on the soil pH and other factors that limit iron availability3. However, some factors that can increase the risk of iron deficiency include poor drainage, high lime content, compaction, overwatering, and excess nitrogen or phosphate fertilization4.
The period of disease onset for iron deficiency varies depending on the environmental conditions and the severity of the disorder. However, some symptoms may appear in the early to mid-summer, when the leaves start to turn yellow or light green with green veins4. The environmental conditions required for iron deficiency are mainly related to the soil pH and oxygen levels. Iron deficiency is more likely to occur in soils with a pH above 7, which makes iron insoluble and unavailable to plants2. Low oxygen levels in the soil can also reduce the ability of roots to take up iron, especially in poorly drained or compacted soils2.
Iron deficiency does not have an overwintering method, as it is not a disease that survives in the soil or plant tissues. However, iron deficiency can persist or recur in successive seasons if the soil conditions are not corrected4.
Chemical methods involve applying iron sources to the soil or the plant tissues, such as ferrous sulfate, iron chelates, or iron oxides1 2 3. The application dose, period and number of applications depend on the severity of the deficiency, the soil pH and the type of iron source. For example, soil application of ferrous sulfate may require 500 g per tree2, while trunk injection of ferrous sulfate may require 0.5% to 2% solutions1.
Physical methods involve creating wounds on the tree branches or trunks to enhance iron uptake, such as limb scoring or tree injection1 2. These methods can provide rapid and lasting correction of iron deficiency, but may also cause injury or infection to the tree.

Agricultural methods involve improving the soil conditions and cultural practices to increase iron availability, such as mulching, composting, drainage, aeration, irrigation and fertilization2 3. These methods can prevent or reduce iron deficiency by lowering the soil pH, increasing the organic matter content and oxygen levels, and avoiding excess nitrogen or phosphate.
["Iron deficiency in peach trees are mainly related to the reduction of chlorophyll synthesis, which leads to interveinal chlorosis2 3.", "This means that the leaves turn yellow or pale green between the veins, while the veins remain green.", "The chlorosis usually starts from the young leaves at the tips of the branches and spreads to the older leaves if the deficiency is severe2.", "In advanced stages of iron deficiency, the leaves may also show necrosis, which means that they turn brown and die2.", "This can result in leaf drop, twig dieback and reduced fruit quality and yield2 3."]
["Iron deficiency in peach trees, as it is not a disease caused by a pathogen.", "Therefore, there is no physical evidence of a pathogen on the plant tissues.", "However, iron deficiency can be diagnosed by soil and leaf analysis, which can measure the soil pH and the iron content of the plant tissues2 3."]
I could not find any information on the resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of iron deficiency in peach. However, I found some information on the resistance of the phytopathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, which causes bacterial canker in peach trees. According to one source, this bacterium has a mechanism of resistance to copper-based bactericides, which involves the production of a copper-binding protein called CopA. The level of resistance depends on the expression of the CopA gene and the presence of plasmids that carry additional copper resistance genes. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of iron deficiency in peach is the LOPAT test, which stands for levan production, oxidase reaction, pectolytic activity, arginine dihydrolase activity, and tobacco hypersensitivity. This test can differentiate Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae from other Pseudomonas species based on their biochemical and physiological characteristics. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of iron deficiency in peach is not clear, but it may involve the interaction of several factors, such as environmental stress, soil pH, rootstock susceptibility, and pathogen virulence. One possible factor is the type and number of pathogenic effectors, which are proteins secreted by the bacteria that manipulate host cell processes and trigger plant defense responses. Some examples of effectors produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae are AvrPto, AvrPtoB, HopZ1a, HopAA1, and HopAB2. These effectors may have different roles and targets in different plants, depending on their compatibility with host receptors and signaling pathways. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of iron deficiency in peach are not well known, but some studies have identified some genes that may be involved in plant resistance or susceptibility to bacterial canker. For example, one study found that a gene called PpNPR1, which encodes a key regulator of plant immunity, was downregulated in peach leaves infected by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. Another study found that a gene called PpWRKY70, which encodes a transcription factor involved in plant defense responses, was upregulated in peach leaves infected by the same bacterium. These genes may be potential candidates for knockout or overexpression experiments to test their role in peach resistance or susceptibility to bacterial canker.
