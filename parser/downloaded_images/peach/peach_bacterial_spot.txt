The type of crop of peach is a horticultural crop1, also known as a fruit crop. The type of disease of bacterial spot is a bacterial disease1 2 3 4, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic bacterium of bacterial spot is by binary fission, which is a process of cell division that produces two identical cells4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of bacterial spot are influenced by rain, wind, dew, insects, and pruning tools5 2 3 4. The bacterium survives in cracks in the bark and leaf scars and infects the leaves and fruits of susceptible plants. The bacterium then produces small, reddish-purple spots on the plant tissues that may fall out and create a shot-hole appearance1 2 3 4.
The period of disease onset for bacterial spot is usually in the spring and summer1 2, when temperatures are warm and humidity is high. However, symptoms may appear earlier or later depending on environmental conditions and plant stress factors1. The environmental conditions required for bacterial spot are warm, humid, and wet conditions1 2 3 4. The optimal temperature for infection is 77 to 86 в„‰ (25 to 30 в„ѓ)4. The disease is more severe in areas with poor air circulation and sandy soils1 2.
The overwintering method of bacterial spot is by surviving as cells or biofilms in the soil or plant debris1 2. The bacterium can persist in the soil for several months without a host plant4.

Planting resistant varieties of peach1.Pruning out any diseased or dead limbs1.Avoiding overhead watering and using drip irrigation instead1.Watering early in the day to reduce humidity1.
Applying copper-based bactericides before and during bloom2.
Applying oxytetracycline or streptomycin during the growing season2.

The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: I could not find any specific information on the mechanism of resistance, the type of resistance agent, or the level of resistance of the fungus that causes bacterial spot in peach. However, some sources suggest that using resistant varieties1 2, removing infected leaves and fruits2, increasing air circulation2, and spraying copper-based fungicides3 4 can help reduce the disease severity and spread. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: I could not find any specific information on a quick test method for the fungus that causes bacterial spot in peach. However, some sources suggest that the disease can be identified by the presence of small reddish-purple spots with white centers on leaves3, and small water-soaked markings that enlarge and crack on fruits2. The infected plant parts may turn yellow and drop2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease: I could not find any specific information on the mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of bacterial spot in peach. However, some sources suggest that the bacterium overwinters in cracks in the bark and leaf scars that were infected the previous season2. The bacterium multiplies and spreads by wind or water when temperatures rise above 65 В°F (18 В°C) and budding begins2. The bacterium infects new plants through natural openings or wounds4. The bacterium reduces the photosynthesis and transpiration of the plant, leading to reduced growth and yield4. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease: I could not find any specific information on the potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of bacterial spot in peach. However, some sources suggest that some genes may be involved in conferring resistance or susceptibility to the disease, such as PpXapR1, PpXapR2, PpXapR3, and PpXapR4.
