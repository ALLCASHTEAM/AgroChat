Celery is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible stalks and leaves1. Phyllosticta leaf spot is a fungal disease caused by species of the fungus Phyllosticta, such as Phyllosticta capitalensis and Phyllosticta foliorum2 3.
The pathogenic fungus of this disease reproduces by producing two types of spores: conidia and ascospores. Conidia are asexual spores that are dispersed by water or wind, while ascospores are sexual spores that are released into the air2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and leaf wetness. The disease is more prevalent in warm and humid climates, where the spores can germinate and infect the leaves more easily. The disease is also more severe in plants that are stressed by drought, nutrient deficiency, or insect damage. The disease can be transmitted by airborne or waterborne spores, as well as by contaminated tools or plant debris4 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the host plant, the fungal species, and the environmental conditions. Generally, the symptoms appear within three to six weeks after infection, and become more visible after several weeks2. The symptoms include circular or irregular brown spots with reddish or black borders on the leaves, which may coalesce and cause leaf blight or drop. The spots may also have black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) in the center or along the margins1 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (20-30Г‚В°C) and high humidity (\&gt;90%) for spore germination and infection, and moderate temperature (15-25Г‚В°C) and moderate humidity (60-80%) for spore production and dispersal1. The disease is also favored by frequent rainfall or irrigation, which provides moisture for spore germination and infection, and by prolonged leaf wetness (\&gt;12 hours), which allows the fungus to penetrate the leaf tissue3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving as mycelium or pycnidia in infected plant debris or soil1. The fungus can also survive on alternative hosts such as weeds or other crops3.
Fungicides containing copper salts, copper hydroxide, mancozeb, propiconazole, chlorothalonil, neem oil, sulfur or thiophanate-methyl may have some efficacy against Phyllosticta when applied early in the season as new leaves are developing1 2 3. The application dose, period, and number of applications may vary depending on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may also depend on the environmental conditions and the host resistance2.
Removing and destroying affected leaves or twigs with dieback, together with fallen leaves at the base of the plant, may help reduce the inoculum and prevent further spread of the disease2 4. Pruning the plants to thin the canopy and promote air circulation may also help reduce the humidity and leaf wetness that favor the disease development3.
There is no specific information on biological control agents for this disease, but some general antagonists such as Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, or Pseudomonas fluorescens may have some potential to inhibit the fungal growth or spore germination5. However, more research is needed to evaluate their efficacy and compatibility with other control methods.
Planting resistant or tolerant varieties of celery or other crops may help prevent or reduce the disease incidence and severity2. Crop rotation with non-host crops may also help reduce the soil inoculum and break the disease cycle3. Avoiding overhead irrigation or watering early in the day may help reduce the leaf wetness duration and prevent spore germination and infection3 4. Fertilizing and watering the plants properly may help enhance their vigor and resistance to the disease2.

["The disease signs of this disease are the presence of pycnidia, which are tiny, black, pimple-like structures that produce conidia (asexual spores) of the fungus. They are often visible within or around the leaf spots, and can be observed under a microscope or a hand lens2 3 4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some general mechanisms of resistance to fungicides may include degradation or detoxification of the active ingredient, modification or overexpression of the target site, efflux of the active ingredient out of the cell, or reduction of the active ingredient uptake1. The type of resistance agent may depend on the mode of action of the fungicide, such as demethylation inhibitors (DMI), quinone outside inhibitors (QoI), or multisite inhibitors (MSI)1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal population, the fungicide dose and frequency, and the environmental conditions1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not available, but a general method for detecting Phyllosticta species is by using molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or DNA sequencing2. These techniques can identify the fungal DNA from infected plant samples and compare it with reference sequences from databases2. However, these techniques require specialized equipment and expertise, and may not be feasible for routine diagnosis. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not well understood, but some general mechanisms of fungal pathogenicity may include cuticular penetration, enzymatic degradation, toxin production, or effector secretion3. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the fungal species and strain, and the host plant species and genotype3. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host range, susceptibility, and resistance of the plants, as well as the environmental factors that influence the fungal growth and infection3. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease are not well known, but some general targets for fungal control may include essential genes or pathogenicity genes that are involved in fungal growth, development, metabolism, or virulence4. Knockout lethal genes are genes that cause death or severe defects when they are disrupted or deleted4. However, identifying and targeting these genes may be challenging due to the genetic diversity and complexity of fungi.
