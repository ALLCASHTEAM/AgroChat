Celery is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible stalks and leaves1 2. Bacterial leaf blight of celery is a bacterial disease caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. apii3 1 4 2 5.
The pathogenic bacterium of this disease does not have a fungal mode of reproduction, but it can form biofilms on plant surfaces and survive in plant debris or seeds5. The disease is transmitted by rain, irrigation, wind, or mechanical contact with infected plants or seeds3 6 4 2. The disease development is favored by warm and humid conditions1 4.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the inoculum level, but symptoms can appear within days of infection1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are free moisture on the leaves, high humidity, and temperatures between 25Г‚В°C and 30Г‚В°C3 1 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving in celery refuse and on celery seed3 1.
Applying copper compounds or antibiotics as sprays, paints, or drenches to protect against bacterial infection1 2 3. However, copper-tolerant strains of the bacterium have been reported in some areas1.
Disinfecting transplant trays and equipment regularly to prevent contamination1 2. Trimming or topping transplants when they are dry and applying a copper fungicide immediately after2.
No effective biological control agents have been reported for this disease.
Using seed that has been indexed free of the bacterium or treated with hot water1. Using disease-free transplants and resistant varieties4 1. Avoiding sprinkler irrigation and mechanical contact with infected plants1 2. Planting in well-draining soils and allowing plants to dry before irrigating again5.
["Water-soaked spots on the leaves that become bright yellow and then brown with a yellow halo. The spots are usually angular or rectangular and limited by leaf veins. They may dry out and become papery and tan4 1 2 3.", "The spots may coalesce and cause blighting of the foliage, especially under moist conditions4 1 2.", "The disease usually affects the older leaves that are protected by the plant canopy, except where sprinkler irrigation is used4 1.", "The disease rarely affects the leaf petioles, but when it does, it causes a brown discoloration over the entire petiole, which is called brown stem2."]
["The presence of the bacterium itself on the plant tissues, which can be detected by laboratory tests such as ELISA or PCR5.", "The production of a gray fungus growth on the spots, which is actually a secondary infection by saprophytic fungi that feed on the dead plant tissue4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is not well studied, but some reports indicate that it can develop tolerance to copper compounds, which are commonly used as bactericides1. The mechanism of resistance may involve the production of extracellular polysaccharides that protect the bacterium from copper toxicity. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, which can detect the presence of the bacterium in plant tissues or seeds . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infection of the disease is not fully understood, but it may involve the secretion of type III effectors, which are proteins that can manipulate host cell functions and suppress plant defense responses. The bacterium may also produce phytotoxins that cause necrosis and chlorosis in plant tissues. The bacterium can infect different plants, such as celery, cilantro, parsley, and fennel, but it may have different levels of virulence and host specificity depending on the pathovar. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease are not well known, but some studies have identified some genes that are essential for its survival and pathogenicity, such as <em>rpoN</em>, which encodes a sigma factor involved in nitrogen metabolism and virulence, and <em>hrpL</em>, which encodes another sigma factor that regulates the expression of type III effectors.
