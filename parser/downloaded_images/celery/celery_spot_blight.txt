Celery is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible leaves and stalks1 2. Celery spot blight is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Cercospora apii3 1 4 2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced on the surface of the lesions3 2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The spores are spread by wind and splashing water from irrigation or rain. The disease is most common when temperatures are 60 to 86 degrees F (16 to 30 degrees C) for at least 10 hours with a relative humidity that is near 100%5 1 2.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually within 12 to 14 days of exposure to the spores1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm, humid, and wet conditions that favor spore production and infection3 1 2. The disease also prefers acidic soils with a pH below 6.56.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected celery debris, volunteer celery plants, and seed3 1 2.
Fungicides can be applied immediately after transplanting or as soon as symptoms appear, and repeated three to four times per week during favorable conditions. The type of fungicide and the application dose and period depend on the local recommendations and regulations1 2 3.
Infected plants and plant debris should be removed and disposed of promptly to prevent spore spread and survival1 3.
There is no information on biological control of this disease.
Using disease-free seed, resistant varieties, crop rotation, adequate spacing, and avoiding overhead irrigation are some of the cultural practices that can reduce the risk of infection and disease development1 2 3 4 5.
["On leaves: Light brown, circular to mildly angular lesions that may appear oily or greasy and may have yellow halos. The lesions may also have gray fungal growth. The leaf spots dry out and leaf tissue becomes papery, often splitting and cracking2 3.", "On petioles: Long, brown to gray lesions that may affect the quality and yield of celery2 3."]
["On lesions: Tiny, dark specks that are the reproductive bodies (conidia) of the fungus. They may produce jelly-like threads during damp weather3.", "On seed: The fungus may survive on seed and infect seedlings2 3."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus may have mechanisms to evade or suppress the host defense responses, such as producing toxins, effectors, or enzymes that degrade plant cell walls or interfere with plant signaling pathways . Type of resistance agent: The fungus may develop resistance to certain fungicides by mutations, gene transfer, or detoxification. Level of resistance: The level of resistance may vary depending on the strain of the fungus, the type and dose of the fungicide, and the environmental conditions. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is by using a microscope to observe the spores and fungal structures on the lesions. The spores are dark brown, oval to oblong, and have 3 to 5 septa. The fungal structures are grayish white and consist of conidiophores and conidia. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus may produce various effectors that modulate the host immunity and facilitate infection. For example, some effectors may act as suppressors of plant resistance (SOPs) or necrosis-inducing proteins (NIPs) . The number and diversity of effectors may influence the virulence and host range of the fungus. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus may have different degrees of specificity and compatibility with different plant hosts, depending on the interaction between the fungal effectors and the plant receptors . Some plants may have resistance genes that recognize and respond to certain effectors, while others may not. 
Knockout lethal genes: These are genes that are essential for the survival or growth of the fungus, and their disruption or inhibition would result in fungal death or reduced fitness. Some examples of knockout lethal genes in other fungi are genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, ergosterol biosynthesis, DNA replication, transcription, translation, etc. Host susceptibility genes: These are genes that are required for the susceptibility or compatibility of the host to the fungus, and their disruption or inhibition would result in host resistance or reduced disease severity. Some examples of host susceptibility genes in other plants are genes involved in hormone signaling, cell death regulation, nutrient transport, etc.
