Celery is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible stalks and leaves1. Bacterial leaf spot is a bacterial disease caused by the bacterium <em>Pseudomonas syringae pv. apii</em>2 1 3.
The bacterium does not have a fungus associated with it, so it does not have a mode of reproduction of a pathogenic fungus. The bacterium reproduces by binary fission, which is a process of splitting into two identical cells4. The bacterium is seedborne and can be introduced into transplant greenhouses or production fields through infected seed2 5. The bacterium can also spread via overhead irrigation, splashing water, wind, mechanical operations, or infected plant debris1 3. This leads to the formation of water-soaked spots on the leaves.
The period of disease onset for bacterial leaf spot depends on the environmental conditions and the level of inoculum. Celery bacterial leaf spot is most common during warm, wet weather. The disease can develop within a few days to weeks after infection1. The symptoms usually appear first on the older leaves that are protected by the plant canopy1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and moist conditions. The optimal temperature range for the bacterium is 20Г‚В°C to 30Г‚В°C2. The disease is favored by high relative humidity, frequent rainfall, or dew formation1 3.
The overwintering method of the disease is through undecomposed celery residue in the soil or on the surface1. The bacterium can survive for several months in plant debris or on contaminated equipment3.
Only copper compounds are registered for use against this pathogen, but they offer limited control and may not be effective if applied after the symptoms appear. Copper sprays should be applied on 7-day intervals and according to the label instructions1 2.
Infected plant parts should be removed and destroyed to reduce inoculum. Infected transplants should not be used for planting. Equipment and tools should be disinfected regularly to prevent mechanical transmission1 2.
There is no effective biological control agent for this disease.
The most important control measure is to use seed that has been tested free of the bacterium or treated with hot water (122В°F for 25 minutes). Seed that is at least 2 years old can also reduce the disease incidence. Transplant trays should also be disinfected before use. In the greenhouse, the water pressure from overhead sprinklers should be lowered to prevent entry of bacteria into leaf wounds. In the field, sprinkler irrigation should be avoided and plants should not be handled when wet. Crop rotation with non-host plants can also reduce the survival of the bacterium in the soil1 2.
["Small, water-soaked spots on both sides of the leaf that are usually limited by leaf veins and have an angular, square, or rectangular appearance1 2.", "Yellowing of the spots that gradually turn into brown, necrotic spots with a yellow halo1 2.", "Blighting of the foliage if the spots coalesce and cause extensive tissue death1 2.", "The symptoms usually appear first on the older leaves that are protected by the plant canopy, except where sprinkler irrigation is used1."]
["There are no distinctive signs of this disease, as the bacterium is microscopic and does not produceany visible structures or secretions on the plant surface .", "The only way to confirm the presence of the bacterium is by laboratory tests, such as isolation, culturing, biochemical tests, or molecular techniques ."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is not well studied, but some reports suggest that the bacterium may have intrinsic resistance to some antibiotics, such as streptomycin and tetracycline1. The bacterium may also develop acquired resistance to copper compounds, which are the only registered chemicals for control of this disease2 3. The level of resistance may vary depending on the strain of the bacterium and the environmental conditions2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease is to use a bacterial streaming test. This involves cutting a small piece of infected tissue and placing it in a drop of water on a microscope slide. After a few minutes, the water should be examined under a microscope for the presence of bacterial cells streaming out of the tissue4. This test can be done in the field or in the laboratory, but it does not identify the specific species or pathovar of the bacterium. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not fully understood, but it is likely that the bacterium uses type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the plant cells and manipulate their defense responses. The bacterium may also produce toxins, such as syringomycin and syringopeptin, that cause cell membrane damage and necrosis. The type and number of effectors and toxins may differ among strains of the bacterium and affect their virulence and host range. The bacterium can infect different plants, such as celery, cilantro, parsley, fennel, carrot, and parsnip, but it may have different pathovars that are specific to certain hosts. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacterium of the disease are not well known, but some studies have identified some genes that are involved in plant defense or susceptibility to the bacterium. For example, a gene encoding a receptor-like kinase (RLK) was found to be required for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. apii in Arabidopsis thaliana. Another gene encoding a transcription factor (TF) was found to be induced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. apii infection and modulate plant immunity in celery. These genes may be potential candidates for genetic engineering or breeding for disease resistance.
