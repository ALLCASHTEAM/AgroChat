Celery is a horticultural crop that belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsnips, parsley, and celeriac1. Celery drug damage is a type of fungal disease caused by the pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum .
The pathogenic fungus of celery drug damage reproduces by producing sclerotia, which are hard masses of fungal tissue that can survive in the soil for long periods . The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of celery drug damage are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, and crop rotation. The disease is airborne and spreads by spores that are released from the sclerotia or infected plant debris .
The period of disease onset for celery drug damage varies depending on the weather conditions and the growth stage of the crop. The disease can infect celery at any stage, but it is more severe during flowering and fruiting stages. The environmental conditions required for celery drug damage are cool and wet weather, with temperatures ranging from 10В°C to 25В°C and relative humidity above 80%. The disease also favors poorly drained and acidic soils.
The overwintering method of celery drug damage is through the sclerotia, which can survive in the soil for several years and germinate when favorable conditions occur.
Fungicides such as iprodione, procymidone, and thiophanate-methyl can be applied to prevent or reduce infection by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the pathogen.
Infected plant parts should be removed and destroyed to prevent further spread of the disease. Crop residues should also be removed or buried deeply after harvest.
Some microorganisms such as Trichoderma harzianum, Coniothyrium minitans, and Bacillus subtilis can antagonize or parasitize Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and reduce its survival and infection.
Crop rotation with non-host plants such as cereals, corn, or legumes can reduce the inoculum level of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in the soil. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization and irrigation can also reduce the disease risk.

The mechanism of resistance may involve the ability to produce conidia under a wide range of temperatures and humidity, and to survive in the soil as sclerotia for several years1 2. The type of resistance agent may include some fungicides that are commonly used for other celery diseases, such as early blight and late blight. However, the efficacy and specificity of these fungicides for celery black spot disease are not clear3. The level of resistance may vary depending on the environmental conditions, the disease severity, and the fungicide application frequency and dose3 1. 
I do not have a quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease, because the disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not well understood, but some possible factors are: вЂў	The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but they may include some enzymes or toxins that degrade the plant cell wall or interfere with the plant defense system<sup>1</sup>.вЂў	The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host range and specificity of the fungus. Some common weeds, such as common lambsquarters, redroot pigweed, yellow nutsedge, oakleaf goosefoot, and common groundsel may also serve as hosts for the fungus<sup>3</sup>.
