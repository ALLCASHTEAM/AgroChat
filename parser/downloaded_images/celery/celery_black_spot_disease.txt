Celery is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible stalks and leaves1. Celery black spot disease is a fungal disease caused by the fungus <em>Cercospora apii</em>1. Cercospora apii is a pathogen that may live in the field on celery detritus. Wind and splashing water disperse spores.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by <em>conidia</em>, which are asexual spores that are produced on the surface of the lesions1. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The fungus produces spores when the temperature is between 60 to 86 degrees F (163<sup>0</sup> C) and the relative humidity is near 100% for at least 10 hours1. The spores are spread by wind, splashing water, and farm equipment1.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually 12 to 14 days after exposure to the spores1. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and wet weather, poor drainage, and low calcium levels in the soil1 2 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by hard sclerotia black masses that allow the fungus to survive in the soil for several years2.
spraying with a fungicide immediately after transplanting and at regular intervals when the disease is a threat. The type of fungicide, application dose, application period, and number of applications may vary depending on the local conditions and recommendations. The control effect may also depend on the environmental factors and the disease severity1 2.
removing and destroying infected plant debris, volunteer celery plants, and seeds. Avoid overwatering, splashing water, and soil movement onto the plants. Planting on raised beds to improve drainage1 2.
Using some copper sprays or neem oil for organically grown produce. These may have some antifungal activity and reduce disease incidence1 3.
Using <em>Cercospora</em> resistant seed or disease-free seed treated with fungicides. Practicing crop rotation with non-host plants or resistant varieties. Providing adequate calcium and sulfur fertilizers to the plants to enhance their resistance1 2 4.
["On leaves: light brown, circular to mildly angular, lesions that may appear oily or greasy and may be accompanied by yellow halos. The lesions may also have gray fungal growth. The leaf spots dry out and leaf tissue becomes papery, often splitting and cracking1. On petioles and stems: long, brown to gray lesions that may become sunken and dark brown1 2."]
["The presence of conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced on the surface of the lesions and can be seen as a gray velvety growth1.", "The presence of  hard sclerotia black masses that allow the fungus to survive in the soil for several years and can be seen as rodent droppings2."]
The mechanism of resistance may involve the ability to produce conidia under a wide range of temperatures and humidity and to survive in the soil as sclerotia for several years1 2. The type of resistance agent may include some fungicides that are commonly used for other celery diseases, such as early blight and late blight. However, the efficacy and specificity of these fungicides for celery black spot disease are not clear3. The level of resistance may vary depending on the environmental conditions, the disease severity, and the fungicide application frequency and dose3 1. 
We do not have a quick test method for the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease, because the disease is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium. The fungus can be identified by the means of barcode regions such as, ITS, actin (ACT) and translation elongation factor (EF) 1-О±.
The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown, but they may include some enzymes or toxins that degrade the plant cell wall or interfere with the plant defense system1. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the host range and specificity of the fungus. Some common weeds, such as common lambs quarters, redroot pigweed, yellow nutsedge, oakleaf goosefoot, and common groundsel may also serve as hosts for the fungus3.
