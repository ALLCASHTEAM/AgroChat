Celery is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible leaves and stalks1 2. Celery leaf spot disease can be caused by different types of fungi, such as Cercospora apii or Septoria apiicola3 4 5. These fungi cause fungal diseases that affect the leaves and stems of celery plants3 4 5.
The pathogenic fungi of celery leaf spot disease reproduce by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind, water, or insects3 4 5. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of celery leaf spot disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and irrigation6 4 5. The disease is more prevalent and severe during warm, humid, and wet conditions, especially when there is frequent overhead watering or splashing rain3 4 5. The spores can infect celery plants through wounds or natural openings on the leaves and stems3 4 5.
The period of disease onset for celery leaf spot disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the celery variety3 4 5. Generally, the symptoms appear within 12 to 14 days after exposure to the spores3 4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are temperatures between 60 to 86 degrees F (16 to 30 degrees C) and relative humidity near 100% for at least 10 hours3 4. The disease is also favored by poor air circulation, dense planting, and low soil fertility3 4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected seeds or diseased plant debris in the soil or on volunteer celery plants3 4. The spores can also be carried over long distances by wind or contaminated equipment3 4.
Applying fungicides such as bordeaux mixture, copper oxychloride, or mancozeb immediately after transplanting and repeating every 7 to 10 days or as needed1 2 3. The type, dose, and frequency of fungicide application may vary depending on the product label and the local conditions1 2 3. The control effect of fungicides may be reduced by resistance development, environmental factors, or improper application1 2 3.
Removing and destroying infected plants and plant debris to reduce the source of inoculum1 4. Avoiding overhead irrigation or watering early in the day to allow the foliage to dry before nightfall1 4. Increasing the spacing between plants and rows to improve air circulation and reduce humidity1 4.
Using plant extracts such as oleander, henna, bitter melon, cinnamon, white wormwood, pomegranate peels, carps, or eucalyptus to inhibit the growth of the fungus or enhance the plant's resistance5. The effectiveness of these extracts may depend on the concentration, mode of application, and compatibility with other control methods5.
Planting resistant or tolerant celery varieties and disease-free seeds1 4. Practicing crop rotation with non-host crops such as corn, wheat, or soybean for at least three years1 4. Controlling the aster leafhopper population with insecticides or biological agents to prevent the transmission of aster yellows mycoplasma, which can increase the susceptibility of celery to leaf spot disease.
["Cercospora blight: Light brown, circular to mildly angular lesions on the leaves that may appear oily or greasy and may be surrounded by yellow halos. The lesions may also have gray fungal growth on the undersides. The leaf spots dry out and leaf tissue becomes papery, often splitting and cracking. Long, brown to gray lesions on the petioles1.", "Septoria blight: Round yellow lesions on the leaves that coalesce and cause the leaves to become dry and papery. Tiny, dark specks (spores) in the damaged tissue that may produce jelly-like threads during damp weather. The disease affects older, lower foliage first, then moves up to younger leaves. The disease also affects stems and can ruin entire celery plants4."]
["Cercospora blight: Gray fungal growth on the undersides of leaf spots that contains conidia (spores) of Cercospora apii1.", "Septoria blight: Dark specks (spores) in the damaged tissue that are actually pycnidia (fruiting bodies) of Septoria apiicola. The pycnidia may produce jelly-like threads (cirrhi) that contain conidia (spores) during damp weather4."]
The mechanism of resistance may involve mutations or alterations in the target site or metabolic pathway of the fungicide, or enhanced efflux or detoxification of the fungicide by the fungus1. The type of resistance agent may depend on the mode of action and chemical class of the fungicide. For example, the fungus may develop resistance to myclobutanil, which is a demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide, but not to captan, which is a multi-site contact fungicide2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the frequency and intensity of fungicide application, the genetic diversity and fitness of the fungus population, and the environmental conditions1. 
Microscopic examination of leaf spots or lesions for fungal structures such as conidia or pycnidia3 4. This may require staining or mounting techniques to enhance visibility5. Cultural isolation of fungal spores or tissue fragments from infected plant material on selective media such as potato dextrose agar (PDA) or oatmeal agar (OMA)5. This may require incubation at optimal temperature and light conditions for fungal growth and sporulation5. Molecular identification of fungal DNA or RNA extracted from infected plant material or pure fungal cultures using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other techniques5. This may require specific primers or probes that target fungal genes or regions5. 
The type and number of pathogenic effectors, which are molecules secreted by the fungus that manipulate host cell processes and defenses. For example, Cercospora apii secretes cercosporin, a toxin that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causes oxidative damage to host cells. The fungus may also secrete other effectors that suppress host immunity, modulate host metabolism, or facilitate fungal colonization. The differences in infestation of different plants, which may depend on the host range and specificity of the fungus, as well as the resistance or susceptibility of the plant. For example, Cercospora apii can infect several weeds such as common lambsquarters, redroot pigweed, yellow nutsedge, oakleaf goosefoot, and common groundsel without showing symptoms, while Septoria apiicola can infect only celery and its relatives3 4. Some celery varieties may also have different levels of tolerance or resistance to leaf spot disease3 4. 
Knockout lethal genes, which are genes that are essential for fungal survival or pathogenicity. For example, genes involved in cercosporin biosynthesis, detoxification, or regulation may be potential targets for disrupting Cercospora apii pathogenicity. However, identifying and manipulating these genes may be challenging due to technical and ethical issues. Host defense genes, which are genes that are involved in plant immunity or resistance. For example, genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, salicylic acid (SA) signaling components, or resistance (R) proteins may be potential targets for enhancing plant defense against leaf spot disease. However, manipulating these genes may also have unintended consequences such as fitness costs or trade-offs.
