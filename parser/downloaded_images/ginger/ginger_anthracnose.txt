Ginger is a horticultural crop that is cultivated for its aromatic rhizomes1. Anthracnose of ginger is a fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides1 2, which belongs to the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for anthracnose on many plant species3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores produced in acervuli (small, cushion-like fruiting bodies) on the surface of infected plant tissues1 2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and irrigation. The disease is more severe in warm and humid conditions, and the optimum temperature for spore germination and infection is between 25В°C and 30В°C4. The disease is spread by wind, rain, insects, and infected plant materials1 2. The spores can be dispersed by wind or rain splash to neighboring plants, or by insects that feed on the infected tissues. The spores can also survive on infected plant debris or rhizomes and infect new plants when planted or transported2.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the ginger cultivar. The disease can appear at any stage of plant growth, but it is more common during the rainy season or under high humidity1. The disease can cause symptoms on leaves, stems, rhizomes, and flowers of ginger. The symptoms include small, circular, brown to black spots or lesions on the leaves and stems, which may coalesce and cause blighting or defoliation. The rhizomes may show sunken, dark brown lesions that can affect the quality and yield of the crop. The flowers may also show brown spots or blight1 2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature, high humidity, and frequent rainfall or irrigation1 2. These conditions favor the spore production, germination, and infection of the fungus. The disease is less severe in dry and cool climates.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris or rhizomes in the soil or in storage2. The fungus can persist on these materials for several months and infect new plants when favorable conditions occur.
Applying fungicides such as copper-based compounds, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, or benomyl can help reduce the disease severity and protect the healthy plants. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product label, the environmental conditions, and the disease stage1 2.
Removing and destroying the infected plant parts or debris can help prevent the spread of the disease and reduce the inoculum source. Burning or burying the infected materials is recommended1 2.
Using antagonistic microorganisms such as Trichoderma spp., Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., or Streptomyces spp. can help suppress the growth and infection of the fungus. These microorganisms can be applied as seed treatments, soil amendments, or foliar sprays1 2.
Adopting good cultural practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, mulching, weed control, proper spacing, pruning, irrigation management, and sanitation can help enhance the plant health and resistance to the disease. Avoiding planting ginger in areas with a history of anthracnose or using disease-free planting materials can also help prevent the disease introduction and establishment1 2.

["Pinkish to orange spore masses that ooze out from the acervuli (small, cushion-like fruiting bodies) on the surface of infected plant tissues1 2.", "Dark brown to black setae (hair-like structures) that surround the acervuli on the infected tissues1 2.", "Conidia (asexual spores) that are hyaline (translucent), cylindrical to fusiform (spindle-shaped), and one-celled or septate (divided by cross-walls)1 2."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is the ability of the fungus to survive or overcome the adverse effects of fungicides or host resistance. Some examples are: The mechanism of resistance to fungicides may involve alterations in the target site, increased detoxification or efflux of the fungicide, or reduced uptake or penetration of the fungicide1 2. The type of resistance agent may depend on the mode of action and chemical class of the fungicide. For example, benzimidazole fungicides such as benomyl act by inhibiting the ГЋВІ-tubulin function in fungal cells, and resistance to this group of fungicides is mainly due to point mutations in the ГЋВІ-tubulin gene1 2. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungal population, the fungicide dose and frequency, and the environmental conditions. Resistance may be qualitative or quantitative, depending on whether it is controlled by a single gene or multiple genes, and whether it confers complete or partial resistance1 2. The resistance to host resistance may involve changes in the pathogenicity or virulence of the fungus, such as alterations in the production or recognition of pathogenic effectors that interact with host resistance genes3 . 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is a rapid and simple technique that can be used to identify or diagnose the fungus from infected plant samples. Some examples are: olymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular technique that can amplify specific DNA sequences from the fungus using primers that are designed based on unique regions of the fungal genome. PCR can be used to detect and differentiate Colletotrichum species from infected plant tissues . Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is another molecular technique that can amplify DNA sequences from the fungus under isothermal conditions using a set of four or six primers that recognize six or eight regions of the target sequence. LAMP can be used to detect Colletotrichum species from infected plant tissues with high specificity and sensitivity . Immunological methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) are based on the use of antibodies that can bind to specific antigens from the fungus. These methods can be used to detect Colletotrichum species from infected plant tissues with high specificity and sensitivity . 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is how the fungus infects and colonizes the host plant and causes disease symptoms. Some examples are: The type and number of pathogenic effectors are molecules that are secreted by the fungus during infection and can modulate host defense responses or manipulate host metabolism. Colletotrichum species have been shown to produce various types of effectors, such as necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptides (NEPs), cerato-platanins (CPs), chorismate mutases (CMs), glucanase inhibitors (GIPs), and secondary metabolites (SMs) . The number and diversity of effectors may vary depending on the fungal species, strain, and host range . 
The differences in infestation of different plants are related to the host specificity and adaptation of the fungus. Colletotrichum species have been classified into different lifestyles, such as hemibiotrophic, necrotrophic, or endophytic, depending on their interaction with different hosts . For example, C. gloeosporioides has a broad host range and can infect many plants as a hemibiotroph or an endophyte, while C. scovillei has a narrow host range and can infect only pepper as a necrotroph.
