Toona is a genus of trees in the Meliaceae family, which are mainly used for timber production. They are not considered as cash crops, horticultural crops or staple crops. 1 Toona rust is a disease caused by a fungus of the order Pucciniales, which are also known as rust fungi. Rust fungi are plant pathogens that produce spore masses of various colors on the plant surfaces. 2
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of Toona rust is not clear from the web sources I found. However, most rust fungi produce different types of spores in different stages of their life cycle, such as conidia, urediniospores, teliospores and basidiospores. These spores can be dispersed by wind, water, insects or other agents. 2 The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of Toona rust is also not clear from the web sources I found. However, some general factors that influence the development and spread of rust diseases are: host susceptibility and resistance, environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and rainfall, and presence of alternate hosts that can complete the life cycle of the fungus. 3
The period of disease onset for Toona rust is not specified in the web sources I found. However, some general symptoms of rust diseases are: appearance of orange, red, yellow or brown pustules or spots on leaves and stems, premature leaf fall, stunted growth, reduced photosynthesis and yield. Rust diseases are usually more severe in late summer through autumn. 4 5 The environmental conditions required for Toona rust are not specified in the web sources I found. However, some general conditions that favor rust diseases are: high humidity and moisture on plant surfaces, moderate to warm temperatures, and susceptible host plants. Rust fungi can survive in dry conditions as dormant spores until favorable conditions return. 4 5
The overwintering method of Toona rust is not specified in the web sources I found. However, some general methods that rust fungi use to overwinter are: producing thick-walled teliospores that can survive low temperatures and germinate in spring, infecting alternate hosts that can carry the fungus through winter, or remaining as mycelium inside plant tissues that do not die in winter. 2 4
Select rust-resistant plant varieties when available.
Pick off and destroy infected leaves and frequently rake under plants to remove all fallen debris.
Water in the early morning hours Гўв‚¬вЂќ avoiding overhead sprinklers Гўв‚¬вЂќ to give plants time to dry out during the day. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to keep water off the foliage and stems.
Improve air circulation around plants by thinning, pruning or staking them.
["According to 1, the signature symptom of rust is the orange, yellow, brown, or red spore masses on the outside of the plant. These spores appear as raised dots on the leaves or stems of the plant. Some types of rust form galls that then become covered in the spore masses. Rust occasionally forms on blooms. Symptoms occur from the ground up. They are usually on the underside of the leaves but may also appear on the top of them. Rust may cause witches broom growth (redish, twisted stems and leaves), cankers, oozes, and spotted needles. Rust may cause leaves to fall prematurely. If enough of the leaves fall, the plant may die. Plants may be stunted, off color, and weak."]
["According to 1, disease signs are the physical evidence of the pathogen itself on the plant. For rust fungi, these are the spore masses that are visible on the plant surfaces. The spores are usually orange, yellow, brown, or red in color and have a powdery or dusty appearance. The spores can be easily rubbed off with a finger or a cloth. The spores are produced by different structures depending on the type and stage of the rust fungus. These structures include spermogonia, aecia, uredinia, telia, and basidia."]
The phytopathogenic fungus of Toona rust is Puccinia psidii, also known as myrtle rust or guava rust1. It is a highly variable and adaptable fungus that can infect many plant species in the Myrtaceae family2. The mechanism of resistance of this fungus is not well understood, but some studies have suggested that it may involve effector-triggered immunity (ETI), which is a plant defense system that recognizes specific molecules produced by the pathogen and activates resistance responses2. The type of resistance agent may vary depending on the host plant and the fungal strain, but some examples are resistance (R) genes, which encode proteins that recognize effectors, and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, which are induced by ETI and have antifungal activity2. The level of resistance may also depend on the genetic diversity of both the host and the pathogen, as well as environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of Toona rust is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is a technique that amplifies specific DNA sequences from a sample3. PCR can be used to detect the presence and identity of P. psidii by using primers that target its internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, which is a highly variable part of the fungal genome that can be used for molecular identification3. PCR can be performed in a laboratory or in the field using portable devices and kits3. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of Toona rust involves several steps: spore germination, appressorium formation, penetration, haustorium formation, and sporulation4. Spore germination is the process by which the fungal spores land on a susceptible host plant and produce germ tubes that grow toward the plant surface4. Appressorium formation is the process by which the germ tubes differentiate into specialized structures called appressoria, which are used to attach to the plant cuticle and generate pressure to breach it4. Penetration is the process by which the fungus enters the plant tissue through natural openings (stomata) or directly through the cuticle using a penetration peg4. Haustorium formation is the process by which the fungus produces feeding structures called haustoria, which are inserted into the plant cells and establish a biotrophic relationship with them4. Sporulation is the process by which the fungus produces new spores on the infected plant tissue, which can then be dispersed by wind or rain to infect new hosts4. The type and number of pathogenic effectors produced by P. psidii are not fully known, but some studies have identified some candidates, such as PpEC1, PpEC2, and PpEC3, which are small secreted proteins that may modulate plant immunity or metabolism2. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the compatibility between the host R genes and the fungal effectors, as well as other factors such as plant morphology, physiology, and phenology2. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of Toona rust are not clear, as there is no evidence of bacterial involvement in this disease. However, some studies have reported that some bacteria may act as endophytes or biocontrol agents in plants infected by P. psidii, meaning that they may live inside the plant tissue without causing harm or may protect the plant from fungal infection by producing antifungal compounds or inducing plant resistance. Some examples of these bacteria are Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Streptomyces spp.
