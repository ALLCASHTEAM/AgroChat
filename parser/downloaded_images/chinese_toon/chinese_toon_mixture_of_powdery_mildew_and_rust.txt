The type of crop of Toona is a horticultural crop. Toona is a genus of flowering plants in the mahogany family that are grown for their timber, edible leaves, and medicinal properties1. The type of disease of the mixture of powdery mildew and rust of Toona is a fungal disease. Powdery mildew and rust are both caused by different species of fungi that infect the leaves and stems of plants2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of powdery mildew is conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in chains on specialized structures called conidiophores2. The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of rust is urediniospores, which are dikaryotic spores that are produced in pustules on the infected plant tissue3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of powdery mildew is airborne. The conidia are dispersed by wind or splashing water and can infect new plants when they land on a suitable host4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of rust is also airborne. The urediniospores are carried by wind or rain and can infect new plants when they germinate on a susceptible host3.
The period of disease onset for powdery mildew is usually late in the growing season when the weather is warm and dry, but the relative humidity around the plant is high2. The period of disease onset for rust is usually early to mid-season when the weather is cool and moist, but not too wet3. The environmental conditions required for powdery mildew are warm (60-80Г‚В°F / 15-27Г‚В°C), dry climates, with high relative humidity around the plant2. The environmental conditions required for rust are cool (50-70Г‚В°F / 10-21Г‚В°C), moist climates, with frequent dew formation or light rain3.
The overwintering method of powdery mildew is mycelium or cleistothecia. Mycelium is the vegetative part of the fungus that grows on or inside the plant tissue and can survive low temperatures or drought. Cleistothecia are closed structures that contain sexual spores called ascospores that can survive harsh conditions and germinate in spring2. The overwintering method of rust is teliospores or alternate hosts. Teliospores are thick-walled spores that are produced at the end of the season and can survive winter on fallen leaves or stems. Alternate hosts are different plant species that can harbor different stages of the rust fungus and allow it to complete its life cycle3.
According to one source1, chemical fungicides are generally ineffective against powdery mildew, but they may help reduce the severity of the disease if applied early and regularly. Some of the fungicides that may be used include sulfur, lime-sulfur, neem oil, and potassium bicarbonate2. Another source3 suggests using a homemade spray of baking soda, vegetable oil, and water to control the spread of the fungus. However, these treatments may not be effective against rust, which is a different type of fungal disease that causes orange or brown pustules on the leaves and stems of infected plants. Rust may require more specific fungicides, such as triazoles, strobilurins, or mancozeb4. The choice and application of fungicides should follow the label instructions and local regulations.
One of the most important physical measures to prevent and control powdery mildew and rust is to remove and destroy any infected plant parts, such as leaves, stems, flowers, or fruits1 5. This will reduce the amount of spores that can infect other plants or overwinter in the soil. Another physical measure is to prune the plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage1 5. This will make the environment less favorable for fungal growth and infection. A third physical measure is to avoid overhead watering or wetting the leaves when irrigating1 5. This will prevent moisture from accumulating on the plant surfaces and creating conditions for spore germination and infection.
There is not much information on biological control of powdery mildew and rust of Toona. However, some general principles of biological control may apply. Biological control involves using natural enemies, such as predators, parasites, or pathogens, to suppress or kill the target pest or disease. For example, some beneficial insects, such as ladybugs or lacewings, may feed on powdery mildew spores or fungal hyphae. Some bacteria or fungi may also compete with or antagonize powdery mildew or rust fungi. However, biological control agents may have limited availability, efficacy, or specificity, and they may also pose risks to non-target organisms or human health. Therefore, biological control should be used with caution and in conjunction with other methods.
Agricultural control refers to using cultural practices or resistant varieties to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of powdery mildew and rust. Some of the agricultural control methods include:Planting in full sun where possible (except for shade-loving plants) to allow condensation and dew to dry quickly and reduce humidity1 5.Spacing plants well apart to enhance air circulation and avoid crowding1 5.Choosing disease-resistant cultivars or species that are less susceptible to powdery mildew or rust1 5. For example, some bean varieties have resistance to both diseases6.Rotating crops or avoiding planting susceptible plants in the same area for several years to reduce inoculum buildup in the soil.Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization that may promote lush growth and susceptibility to fungal diseases.
["Powdery mildew: The most characteristic symptom of powdery mildew is the presence of whitish-gray, talcum-like powdery patches of fungal growth on the upper or lower leaf surfaces, stems, flowers, or fruits1 5. These patches may coalesce to cover large areas of the plant surface. The infected tissues may show little reaction at first, but later they may become stunted, distorted, discolored (yellow or purple), wilted, or die1 5. Powdery mildew may also affect plant growth, flowering, fruiting, and quality1 5.", "Rust: The most characteristic symptom of rust is the presence of orange or brown pustules (uredinia) on the lower leaf surfaces or stems of infected plants. These pustules contain masses of spores (urediniospores) that can be easily rubbed off. The infected tissues may also develop yellow spots (chlorosis) on the upper leaf surfaces corresponding to the pustules below. Rust may cause premature leaf drop, reduced photosynthesis, weakened plant vigor, reduced yield and quality, and increased susceptibility to other pests or diseases."]
["Powdery mildew: The disease signs of powdery mildew are the same as the symptoms: the whitish-gray powdery patches of fungal growth on the plant surfaces. These patches consist of fungal hyphae (filaments) and spores (conidia) that can be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope. The spores are usually produced in chains from specialized structures called conidiophores. The shape and arrangement of these structures can help identify the specific fungus causing powdery mildew.", "Rust: The disease signs of rust are also similar to the symptoms: the orange or brown pustules containing spores on the plant surfaces. These pustules can also be seen with a magnifying glass or a microscope. The spores are usually produced in clusters from specialized structures called uredinia. The shape and size of these structures can help identify the specific fungus causing rust.", "Citation format:"]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of powdery mildew and rust of Toona is not well studied, but some general aspects of fungicide resistance in powdery mildew fungi can be summarized as follows1:Powdery mildew fungi are among the most common and important plant fungal pathogens. They are obligate biotrophic parasites that attack nearly 10,000 species of angiosperms, including major crops, such as cereals and grapes.Powdery mildew fungi have a high genetic variability and a short generation time, which allow them to adapt quickly to changing environmental conditions and host resistance.Powdery mildew fungi are considered to be high-risk pathogens for developing fungicide resistance, due to their high mutation rate, large population size, clonal reproduction and low recombination frequency.Fungicide resistance in powdery mildew fungi can be classified into three main types: target site mutations, metabolic detoxification and reduced uptake or increased efflux of fungicides.Target site mutations are the most common and durable type of resistance, which involve alterations in the amino acid sequence of the enzyme or protein that is the target of the fungicide. For example, mutations in the cytochrome b gene confer resistance to QoI fungicides, such as azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin.Metabolic detoxification involves the activation of enzymes that degrade or modify the fungicide molecule, rendering it less toxic or ineffective. For example, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in detoxifying DMI fungicides, such as tebuconazole and prothioconazole.Reduced uptake or increased efflux of fungicides are mechanisms that decrease the concentration of the fungicide inside the fungal cell, by limiting its penetration through the cell wall or membrane, or by actively pumping it out of the cell. For example, ABC transporters are involved in effluxing MBC fungicides, such as thiophanate-methyl and carbendazim. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of powdery mildew and rust of Toona is not available online, but some general methods for detecting and identifying powdery mildew fungi are as follows2:Visual inspection: Powdery mildew fungi can be recognized by their characteristic white or gray powdery growth on leaves, stems and flowers. However, this method may not be reliable for early detection or for distinguishing different species of powdery mildew fungi.Microscopy: Powdery mildew fungi can be observed under a light microscope by using a wet mount or a tape mount technique. The morphology and arrangement of conidia (asexual spores), conidiophores (spore-bearing structures) and appressoria (infection structures) can be used to identify different genera and species of powdery mildew fungi. However, this method may require expert knowledge and specialized equipment.Molecular techniques: Powdery mildew fungi can be detected and identified by using molecular techniques based on DNA or RNA analysis. These techniques include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), DNA barcoding and next-generation sequencing (NGS). These techniques can provide rapid, sensitive and specific identification of powdery mildew fungi at different taxonomic levels. However, these techniques may require expensive reagents and equipment. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of powdery mildew and rust of Toona is not well studied, but some general aspects of powdery mildew pathogenesis can be summarized as follows2:Powdery mildew fungi are obligate biotrophs that require living host cells for their survival and reproduction. They establish a specialized feeding structure called a haustorium inside the host cell, which allows them to extract nutrients and suppress host defense responses.Powdery mildew fungi use different strategies to infect their host plants, depending on their degree of host specificity. Some powdery mildew fungi are non-host-specific (polyphagous), meaning that they can infect a wide range of plant species. These fungi use a passive penetration strategy, which involves the formation of a simple appressorium on the surface of the host cell wall, followed by mechanical pressure and enzymatic degradation to breach the cell wall and form a haustorium. Other powdery mildew fungi are host-specific (monophagous or oligophagous), meaning that they can infect only one or a few related plant species. These fungi use an active penetration strategy, which involves the formation of a complex appressorium with a lobed base and a narrow neck on the surface of the host cell wall, followed by chemical signaling and recognition between the fungus and the host cell to induce cell wall opening and haustorium formation.Powdery mildew fungi secrete various molecules that facilitate their infection and colonization of host plants. These molecules include effectors, enzymes, toxins and hormones. Effectors are small proteins that modulate host defense responses or manipulate host metabolism to benefit the fungus. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions involved in cell wall degradation or nutrient acquisition. Toxins are small molecules that inhibit host growth or induce cell death. Hormones are small molecules that regulate plant growth and development. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of powdery mildew and rust of Toona are not available online, but some general aspects of plant immunity against powdery mildew fungi can be summarized as follows2:Plant immunity against powdery mildew fungi can be divided into two main types: non-host resistance and host resistance. Non-host resistance is a broad-spectrum immunity that prevents infection by most potential pathogens. Host resistance is a specific immunity that recognizes and responds to particular pathogens or pathogen strains.Non-host resistance against powdery mildew fungi involves physical barriers (such as cuticle, wax layer and trichomes) and chemical barriers (such as antimicrobial compounds) that prevent fungal attachment or penetration. It also involves basal defense responses (such as oxidative burst, callose deposition and phytoalexin production) that limit fungal growth or spread.Host resistance against powdery mildew fungi involves two main mechanisms: quantitative resistance (QR) and qualitative resistance (R-gene-mediated resistance). QR is a partial resistance that reduces fungal infection or colonization by activating multiple defense genes or pathways. QR is often controlled by multiple genes with additive effects and is effective against different strains or species of powdery mildew fungi. R-gene-mediated resistance is a complete resistance that prevents fungal infection or colonization by recognizing specific fungal effectors through plant receptors encoded by R genes. R-gene-mediated resistance is often controlled by single genes with dominant effects and is effective against specific strains or races of powdery mildew fungi.
