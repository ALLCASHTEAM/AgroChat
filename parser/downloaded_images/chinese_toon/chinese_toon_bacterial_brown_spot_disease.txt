Toona is a genus of trees in the mahogany family that are native to Asia and Australia. They are not considered as cash crops, horticultural crops or staple crops, but rather as timber trees that are valued for their wood1. Bacterial brown spot disease of Toona is caused by a bacterium called <em>Pseudomonas syringae pv. toonae</em>2. It is a bacterial disease that affects the leaves and shoots of Toona trees2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic bacterium of this disease is not a fungus, so it does not produce conidia or mobile spores. Instead, it reproduces by binary fission, which is a process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are not well studied, but it is likely that the bacterium can spread by wind, rain, insects, or infected plant material4 5. The bacterium can enter the plant through natural openings (such as stomata or hydathodes) or wounds (such as pruning cuts or insect damage)5.
The period of disease onset for this disease is not clearly defined, but it may depend on the environmental conditions and the susceptibility of the host plant. The symptoms may appear within a few days or weeks after infection2. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high humidity and moderate temperature (around 25 В°C)2. The bacterium can survive in low temperatures (below 0 В°C) and high temperatures (above 35 В°C), but it is less active and less virulent2. The soil conditions may not have a significant effect on the disease, as the bacterium mainly infects the aerial parts of the plant2.
The overwintering method of this disease is not well known, but it is possible that the bacterium can survive on infected plant debris or latent infections in asymptomatic plants2 5.




["Leaf spots: Small, circular, water-soaked spots appear on both sides of the leaves, which later turn brown and necrotic. The spots may coalesce and cause leaf blight and defoliation1.", "Shoot blight: Young shoots show wilting, browning and dieback symptoms. The bark may crack and ooze bacterial exudates1.", "Canker: Dark brown to black lesions form on the stems and branches, which may girdle and kill the affected parts. The cankers may also exude bacterial slime1."]
["Bacterial streaming: When a piece of infected tissue is cut and placed in water, a milky white stream of bacteria can be seen flowing out from the cut surface1.", "Bacterial colonies: When a sample of infected tissue or exudate is cultured on a suitable medium, such as King's B agar, yellowish-white, circular, convex colonies with entire margins can be observed after 48 hours of incubation at 28Г‚В°C1."]
I do not have the information for this item. The phytopathogenic fungus of Toona brown spot disease is Alternaria alternata1 2, which is not a bacterium. Therefore, the question of resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of Toona bacterial brown spot disease does not make sense.

The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of Toona bacterial brown spot disease are not clear, as there is no evidence that bacteria are involved in this disease. However, some studies have reported that bacterial diseases can affect other plants in the same family as Toona, such as beans and tomatoes3 4. Some examples of these diseases are bacterial spot, caused by <em>Xanthomonas spp.</em>, and halo blight, caused by <em>Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola</em>3 4. These diseases can cause symptoms such as water-soaked spots, necrotic lesions, yellow halos, and fruit scabs on leaves and pods3 4. Some possible targets of these bacteria are genes involved in plant immunity, such as resistance genes (R genes) and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which can recognize and respond to bacterial molecules. Another possible target is genes involved in plant growth and development, such as hormone biosynthesis and signaling genes, which can be affected by bacterial toxins or effectors.
