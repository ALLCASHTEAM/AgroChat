Sweet potato is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Convolvulaceae1. Sweet potato black star disease is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Lasiodiplodia theobromae2 3. It is also known as Java black rot or Diplodia tuber rot3.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by pycnidia, which are flask-shaped structures that produce asexual spores called conidia2 3. The conidia are hyaline or pale brown, cylindrical, and have 1Гўв‚¬вЂњ4 septa2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The disease is mainly soilborne, as the fungus can survive in the soil for several years and infect the roots through wounds or natural openings2 3. The disease can also be spread by contaminated tools, planting material, or insects2 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the cultivar of sweet potato. However, it usually occurs in the post-harvest stage, after a few days of storage2 3. The disease can also occur in the field, especially in warm and humid regions2 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (above 25Г‚В°C), high humidity (above 80%), and frequent rainfall. These conditions favor the germination of conidia and the infection of sweet potato roots2 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on crop residues or on alternative hosts, such as weeds or other plants in the same family as sweet potato2 3.
Application of appropriate fungicides, such as thiabendazole, can help to prevent or reduce the disease. However, fungicides should be used with caution and according to the label instructions, as they may have negative effects on human health and the environment1 2.
Cutting off and destroying the infected parts of the plant can reduce the spread of the disease. Burning or burying the infected plant material can also help to eliminate the source of inoculum1 2.
Some natural enemies of the pathogen, such as antagonistic fungi and bacteria, can be used to suppress the disease. For example, Trichoderma harzianum and Bacillus subtilis have been reported to inhibit the growth of Lasiodiplodia theobromae3.
Crop rotation with non-host plants can break the disease cycle and reduce the inoculum level in the soil. Avoiding planting sweet potato in fields with a history of the disease or with crop residues of sweet potato can also help to prevent infection. Planting resistant cultivars or using disease-free planting material can also reduce the disease incidence and severity1 2.
["They are brown to reddish brown, round sunken lesions on the roots that have a solid black center, surrounded by a soft, pinkish ring of decaying tissues.", "The lesions become hard, sunken and completely blackened due to the presence of mature mycelium and stromatic tissue.", "The disease may also affect the stems and leaves, causing them to become brown and wilted1 2 3."]
["They are pycnidia and conidia of the pathogen that can be observed on the surface of the lesions.", "The pycnidia are flask-shaped structures that produce conidia.", "The conidia are hyaline or pale brown, cylindrical, and have 1й€Ґ? septa1 2 3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some sources suggest that it can survive in soil for several years and can infect a wide range of host plants1. The fungus may produce toxins that inhibit the growth of other microorganisms and protect it from adverse environmental conditions2. The type and level of resistance agent are unknown. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is to examine the infected roots for characteristic symptoms, such as round sunken lesions with solid black centers, surrounded by soft, pinkish rings of decaying tissues3. The lesions become hard, sunken and completely blackened due to the presence of mature mycelium and stromatic tissue3. The fungus can also be isolated from the infected tissue and cultured on a potato-dextrose-agar medium, forming fluffy gray colonies that become black with age2. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is not well understood, but it is likely that the fungus enters through wounds or natural openings in the roots and colonizes the outer vascular layer of the tuber4. The fungus may secrete enzymes that degrade the cell wall and cause tissue necrosis2. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are unknown. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the susceptibility of the host, the environmental conditions, and the presence of other pathogens or pests1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are also unknown, but some studies have suggested that genes involved in plant defense, stress response, cell wall modification, and hormone signaling may be affected by bacterial infection5. Knockout lethal genes are those that are essential for the survival or growth of an organism, and their disruption may result in death or severe defects. Some examples of knockout lethal genes in plants are those encoding ribosomal proteins, DNA polymerases, or photosynthetic components.
