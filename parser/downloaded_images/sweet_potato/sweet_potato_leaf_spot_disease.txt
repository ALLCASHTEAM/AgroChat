Sweet potato is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible tubers and leaves1. Sweet potato leaf spot disease can be caused by different types of pathogens, such as fungal, bacterial, or viral agents2. One of the most common fungal causes is Alternaria bataticola, which causes brown leaf spot and stem blight2.
The pathogenic fungus Alternaria bataticola reproduces by producing conidia, which are asexual spores that are dispersed by wind or rain2. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of sweet potato leaf spot disease depend on the type of pathogen, the environmental conditions, and the host resistance. Generally, the disease is more severe in warm and humid climates, and it can be transmitted by airborne spores, insectborne viruses, or infected plant material2.
The period of disease onset for sweet potato leaf spot disease varies depending on the pathogen and the environmental factors. For example, Alternaria blight can appear as early as 30 days after planting or as late as 90 days before harvest2. The environmental conditions required for sweet potato leaf spot disease also depend on the type of pathogen, but generally they favor high temperature, high humidity, and frequent rainfall2. Some pathogens may also require specific soil conditions, such as pH or nutrient levels1.
The overwintering method of sweet potato leaf spot disease depends on the type of pathogen and the availability of host plants. Some pathogens may survive in the soil or on crop residues, while others may need living plant tissue to overwinter2. For example, Alternaria bataticola can overwinter on infected sweet potato tubers or vines2.
Applying fungicides such as chlorothalonil, phosphorous acid, mancozeb, or copper can help reduce the severity of fungal leaf spot diseases1 2. The type of agent, application dose, application period, number of applications, and control effect may vary depending on the product label and the disease situation.
Removing and destroying infected plant parts can help prevent the spread of the disease to healthy plants3 4. Avoiding wounding or bruising the tubers can also reduce the risk of infection3.
Using beneficial microorganisms such as Trichoderma or Bacillus can help suppress some fungal pathogens by competing with them or producing antimicrobial substances3.
Practicing crop rotation with non-host crops can help reduce the inoculum level in the soil1 3. Planting resistant or tolerant varieties of sweet potato can also help avoid or minimize the disease damage3 4. Maintaining optimal soil pH, moisture, and fertility can also enhance plant health and resistance3.
["Brown leaf spot and stem blight caused by Alternaria bataticola: Small, irregular to circular, dark brown spots on lower leaves, and range in size from a pinpoint to 1/8 inch. The spots may coalesce and cause leaf blight. Dark brown to black lesions may also appear on stems and petioles. Infected tubers may have sunken, dark brown areas1 3.", "Cercospora leaf spot caused by Cercospora bataticola: Small, circular to angular, grayish-white spots with dark brown margins on older leaves. The spots may coalesce and cause premature defoliation. No symptoms are observed on tubers4.", "Viral leaf spot caused by Sweet potato feathery mottle virus: Mottled yellow or green spots on leaves that may become distorted or wrinkled. The spots may be more pronounced along the veins. Infected plants may be stunted and produce fewer or smaller tubers3."]
["Fungal leaf spot diseases: The presence of fungal structures such as conidia, sporodochia, or acervuli on the lower surface of the infected leaves or on the stem lesions. These structures may be visible with a hand lens or a microscope and may have different shapes, sizes, and colors depending on the fungus species1 3 4.", "Viral leaf spot disease: The presence of viral particles or antigens in the plant sap that can be detected by serological tests such as ELISA or PCR3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the type of fungus and the type of resistance agent. For example, some studies have reported that Stemphylium solani, which causes gray leaf spot on sweet potato, has developed resistance to benzimidazole fungicides due to a mutation in the beta-tubulin gene1. The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide dose and the fungal population1. Another example is Alternaria solani, which causes early blight on potato and can also infect sweet potato, has shown resistance to QoI fungicides due to a mutation in the cytochrome b gene. The level of resistance may depend on the frequency of the mutation and the fitness cost of the mutation. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the type of fungus and the availability of diagnostic tools. For example, one method for detecting Stemphylium solani is to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that amplifies a specific region of the fungal DNA2. This method requires a DNA extraction kit, a PCR machine, and specific primers for the fungus2. Another method for detecting Alternaria solani is to use a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that uses antibodies to capture and visualize the fungal antigens. This method requires a LFIA device, a buffer solution, and a sample of infected plant tissue. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease depends on the type of fungus and the type and number of pathogenic effectors. For example, one mechanism for Stemphylium solani is to produce toxins such as alternariol, alternariol monomethyl ether, and tenuazonic acid that cause necrosis and chlorosis on plant cells. The fungus may also produce cell wall degrading enzymes such as polygalacturonase, pectin lyase, and pectate lyase that break down plant cell walls and facilitate fungal penetration. Another mechanism for Alternaria solani is to produce necrotrophic effectors such as AAL-toxin and AK-toxin that induce programmed cell death and oxidative stress on plant cells. The fungus may also produce biotrophic effectors such as nep1-like proteins (NLPs) and small cysteine-rich proteins (SCRPs) that suppress plant immunity and manipulate plant metabolism. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease depend on the type of bacteria and the type of knockout lethal genes. For example, one potential target for Erwinia chrysanthemi, which causes bacterial stem and root rot on sweet potato, is the gene encoding for pectate lyase A (pelA), which is essential for bacterial virulence and tissue maceration. Another potential target for Ralstonia solanacearum, which causes bacterial wilt on sweet potato, is the gene encoding for type III secretion system (T3SS), which is essential for bacterial pathogenicity and effector delivery.
