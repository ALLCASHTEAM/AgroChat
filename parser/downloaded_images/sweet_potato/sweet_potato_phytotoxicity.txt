Sweet potato is a horticultural crop that belongs to the family Convolvulaceae1. Sweet potato drug damage is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Cercospora bataticola2.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in structures called conidiophores2 3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind. The disease is mainly airborne, as the conidia are dispersed by wind or rain splash4 3.
The period of disease onset for this disease varies depending on the environmental conditions and the cultivar of sweet potato. However, it usually occurs in the late season, after 90 days of planting2 3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are high temperature (25-30 В°C), high humidity (above 80%), and frequent rainfall. These conditions favor the germination of conidia and the infection of sweet potato leaves2 3.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on crop residues or on alternative hosts, such as weeds or other plants in the same family as sweet potato2 3.
Application of appropriate fungicides, such as benomyl and chlorothalonil, can help to control the disease. However, fungicides should be used with caution and according to the label instructions, as they may have negative effects on human health and the environment1.
Cutting off and destroying the infected parts of the plant can reduce the spread of the disease. Burning or burying the infected plant material can also help to eliminate the source of inoculum1.
Some natural enemies of the pathogen, such as antagonistic fungi and bacteria, can be used to suppress the disease. For example, Bacillus subtilis and Trichoderma harzianum have been reported to inhibit the growth of Cercospora bataticola2.
Crop rotation with non-host plants can break the disease cycle and reduce the inoculum level in the soil. Avoiding planting sweet potato in fields with a history of the disease or with crop residues of sweet potato can also help to prevent infection. Planting resistant cultivars or using disease-free planting material can also reduce the disease incidence and severity1 2.
["They are circular or irregular spots on the leaves that are initially light brown or grayish-white and later become dark brown or black.", "The spots may coalesce and cause extensive leaf blight and defoliation. The disease may also affect the stems and petioles, causing them to become brown and brittle1 2 3."]
["They are conidiophores and conidia of the pathogen that can be observed on the lower surface of the leaf spots.", "The conidiophores are slender, branched, septate, and hyaline or pale brown.", "The conidia are cylindrical, straight or curved, hyaline or pale brown, and have 3 transverse septa1 2 3."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease depends on the type of fungus and the type of resistance agent. For example, some strains of Cercospora bataticola, the causal agent of sweet potato drug damage, have developed resistance to benzimidazole fungicides, such as benomyl and thiophanate-methyl. The mechanism of resistance is based on a point mutation in the beta-tubulin gene that prevents the binding of the fungicide to the target site1. The level of resistance can be measured by the effective concentration (EC) that inhibits 50% of fungal growth (EC50) in vitro1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is based on molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). These methods can detect and identify the DNA or RNA of the fungus from infected plant samples. PCR requires a thermal cycler and specific primers to amplify the target DNA, while LAMP can be performed at a constant temperature and uses a different set of primers to generate a large amount of DNA2 3. Both methods can produce results within hours and have high sensitivity and specificity. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is based on the interaction between the fungus and the plant host. The fungus produces conidia that are dispersed by wind or rain splash and land on the plant surface. The conidia germinate and penetrate the leaf through stomata or wounds. The fungus then colonizes the intercellular spaces of the leaf tissue and produces more conidia that form visible spots on the leaf surface. The fungus also secretes various enzymes and toxins that degrade the plant cell wall and cause necrosis. The fungus may also produce some pathogenic effectors that modulate the plant immune response and enhance its virulence. The type and number of effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain and the plant cultivar. 
Phytotoxicity refers to the damage caused to plants by exposure to chemicals or other substances. It is not caused by bacteria or any other pathogen. Therefore, there are no specific genes or bacteria associated with phytotoxicity in cabbage.
