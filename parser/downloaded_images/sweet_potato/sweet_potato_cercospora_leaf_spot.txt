Sweet potato is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible tuberous roots1 2. Sweet potato taille leaf spot is a fungal disease caused by the fungus <em>Cercospora ipomoeae</em>3 4.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in structures called conidiophores4. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind. The fungus survives on infected plant debris and produces conidia that are dispersed by wind or rain splash to healthy plants4.
The period of disease onset for this disease is usually in the middle to late stages of the crop growth, when the canopy is dense and the humidity is high4. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid climates, with temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 В°C and relative humidity above 80%. The disease is more severe in areas with frequent rainfall or irrigation4.
The overwintering method of this disease is by surviving on infected plant debris in the soil or on volunteer plants. The fungus can also survive on alternative hosts, such as Ipomoea spp., Convolvulus spp., and other weeds4.
Fungicides such as mancozeb, chlorothalonil, or copper oxychloride can be applied at the first sign of disease or as a preventive measure. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the fungus1 2.
Infected plant parts such as leaves, stems, and roots can be removed and destroyed to reduce the inoculum source and prevent further spread of the disease1 2.
There is no information on biological control agents for this disease.
Cultural practices such as crop rotation, sanitation, weed control, proper spacing, and avoiding overhead irrigation can help reduce the disease incidence and severity1 2.
["Leaf spot: Small, circular to irregular spots with dark brown margins and light brown or gray centers appear on the upper surface of the leaves. The spots may coalesce and cause leaf blight or defoliation. Black dots (conidia) may be visible in the center of the spots1 2.", "Leaf petiole and stem blight: Dark brown lesions may develop on the leaf petioles and stems, causing wilting and dieback of the vines. The lesions may girdle the stem and cause plant death1 2."]
["Conidia: These are asexual spores of the fungus that are produced in structures called conidiophores. They are black, oval to oblong, and single-celled. They are dispersed by wind or rain splash to infect new plants1 2."]
Mechanism of resistance: The fungus may develop resistance to fungicides by altering the target site, increasing the efflux of the fungicide, or degrading the fungicide1. Type of resistance agent: The fungus may be resistant to strobilurin fungicides, which inhibit mitochondrial respiration2 3. Level of resistance: The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide dose, frequency, and mode of action. Resistance may be qualitative or quantitative, cross-resistance or multiple-resistance1. 
Isolation and identification: The fungus can be isolated from infected plant tissues by plating on potato dextrose agar (PDA) or water agar (WA) and incubating at 25 В°C for 5 to 7 days. The fungus can be identified by its morphological characteristics, such as conidiophores, conidia, and pigmentation4. Molecular detection: The fungus can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers that amplify a region of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). The PCR product can be visualized by gel electrophoresis or sequenced for confirmation4. 
Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus may produce various pathogenic effectors, such as toxins, enzymes, and secondary metabolites, that facilitate infection and colonization of the host plant. The type and number of effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain, host genotype, and environmental conditions. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus may have different levels of virulence and host specificity depending on the plant species, cultivar, or genotype. The fungus may also adapt to different hosts by changing its gene expression, genome structure, or mating system. 
Knockout lethal genes: There is no information on knockout lethal genes for this disease.
