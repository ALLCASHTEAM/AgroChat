Sweet potato is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible tuberous roots1. Sweet potato coal stain is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria spp.2. It is also known as Alternaria leaf spot and stem blight2.
The pathogenic fungus of sweet potato coal stain reproduces by conidia, which are asexual spores that are produced in chains on the tips of hyphae3. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of sweet potato coal stain are not well documented, but it is likely that the disease is airborne and spread by winddispersed conidia3. The disease may also be transmitted by infected planting material or contaminated tools3.
The period of disease onset for sweet potato coal stain depends on the environmental conditions, but it is usually more severe in the late season when the plants are mature and the humidity is high3. The environmental conditions required for the disease are warm and humid weather, with temperatures ranging from 20Г‚В°C to 30Г‚В°C and relative humidity above 80%3. The disease also favors poorly drained soils and overcrowded plants that reduce air circulation3.
The overwintering method of sweet potato coal stain is not clear, but it is possible that the fungus survives on infected plant debris or weed hosts in the soil3.
Fungicides such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper can be applied to protect the foliage from infection. The application dose, period, and number of applications depend on the product label and the disease severity. The control effect may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the resistance of the fungus.
Infected plant parts such as leaves and stems can be removed and destroyed to reduce the inoculum source. Infected roots should not be stored or used as planting material.
There is no known biological control agent for this disease.
Crop rotation with non-host crops can help reduce the soil inoculum. Planting resistant or tolerant varieties can also reduce the disease incidence and severity. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization and irrigation can help prevent favorable conditions for the fungus. Improving soil drainage and air circulation can also reduce the humidity and moisture that favor the disease.
["Small, circular to irregular spots appear on the leaves, usually starting from the older ones. The spots are brown to black with purple margins and may coalesce to form large blighted areas. The spots may also have concentric rings or a target-like appearance .", "Dark brown to black lesions appear on the stems, often near the leaf nodes or wounds. The lesions may girdle the stems and cause wilting and dieback of the foliage. The lesions may also produce black conidia under humid conditions .", "Dark brown to black decay occurs on the roots, usually starting from the stem end or wounds. The decay may be superficial or deep, depending on the infection stage. The decayed tissue may be dry or moist and may have a bitter taste ."]
["Black, oval to oblong spores that are produced in chains on the tips of hyphae. The conidia are visible with a hand lens or a microscope on the infected plant parts, especially under humid conditions ."]
Resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: Mechanism of resistance: The fungus may have genetic variations that allow it to overcome the host resistance or the fungicide action. For example, the fungus may have mutations in the target site of the fungicide, or may have enhanced detoxification or efflux mechanisms. Type of resistance agent: The fungus may develop resistance to different types of fungicides, such as benzimidazoles, dicarboximides, demethylation inhibitors, quinone outside inhibitors, or succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors. Level of resistance: The level of resistance may vary depending on the fungicide and the fungal strain. Some strains may have low to moderate levels of resistance, while others may have high levels of resistance. The level of resistance may also change over time due to selection pressure. 
Quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease: Culture method: The fungus can be isolated from infected plant parts and cultured on potato dextrose agar or other suitable media. The fungus can be identified by its morphological characteristics, such as colony color, shape, and texture, and conidial size, shape, and arrangement. Molecular method: The fungus can be detected by molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). These methods can amplify specific DNA sequences of the fungus and provide rapid and accurate identification . 
Mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease: Type and number of pathogenic effectors: The fungus may produce various pathogenic effectors that can manipulate the host defense responses or promote fungal colonization. These effectors may include toxins, enzymes, small secreted proteins, or secondary metabolites. The number and type of effectors may vary depending on the fungal strain and the host genotype. Differences in infestation of different plants: The fungus may have different degrees of virulence or aggressiveness on different plants, depending on the compatibility or incompatibility between the fungal effectors and the host resistance genes. The fungus may also have different preferences or adaptations to different plant species or varieties. 
Potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease: Knockout lethal genes: The fungus may have some essential genes that are required for its survival, growth, or pathogenicity. These genes may be potential targets for developing novel fungicides or biocontrol agents. For example, some genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, ergosterol biosynthesis, signal transduction, or oxidative stress response may be knockout lethal for the fungus.
