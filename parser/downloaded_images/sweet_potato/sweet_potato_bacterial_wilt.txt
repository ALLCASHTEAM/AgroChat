The type of crop of this plant is a root staple crop, which means it is a major source of calories/ starch and nutrients for many people, especially in developing countries1. Sweet potato is also considered a horticultural crop, which means it is grown for its edible parts, such as roots, leaves, and flowers2. Sweet potato is not usually considered as a cash crop, which means it is grown mainly for sale rather than for personal consumption3. The type of disease of this disease is a viral disease, which means it is caused by one or more viruses that infect the plant cells and interfere with their normal functions. Sweet potato plague is also known as sweet potato virus disease (SPVD), which is caused by the synergistic interaction of two viruses: sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV). SPVD is not a fungal, bacterial, oomycete, or physiological disease.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is not applicable, because there is no pathogenic fungus involved in this disease. As mentioned above, SPVD is caused by two viruses, not by a fungus. However, some studies have suggested that some fungi may interact with the viruses and affect the severity of the disease. For example, <em>Fusarium solani</em> may enhance the replication of SPCSV in sweet potato plants. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are complex and variable, depending on the host variety, virus strain, environmental conditions, and vector population. SPVD can be transmitted by vegetative propagation, which means using infected cuttings or tubers to plant new crops. SPVD can also be transmitted by insect vectors, which means using insects that carry the viruses from one plant to another. The main insect vectors for SPFMV are aphids, such as <em>Myzus persicae</em> and <em>Aphis gossypii</em>. The main insect vector for SPCSV is whitefly, such as <em>Bemisia tabaci</em>.
The period of disease onset for this disease is variable, depending on the host variety, virus strain, environmental conditions, and vector population. SPVD symptoms may appear as early as two weeks after infection or as late as several months after infection. SPVD symptoms may also be latent or mild in some plants, making them difficult to detect. SPVD symptoms include leaf reduction and deformation, vein clearing or mosaic, stunting, root cracking and discoloration. The environmental conditions required for the disease are favorable for virus replication and vector activity. SPVD tends to be more severe in regions with high temperature and humidity, which promote virus multiplication and insect movement. SPVD also tends to be more severe in regions with poor soil conditions, such as low fertility, acidity, salinity, or drought stress, which weaken plant resistance.
The overwintering method of this disease is dependent on the availability of host plants and insect vectors. SPVD can overwinter in regions where sweet potato plants can survive the cold season, either in the field or in storage. SPVD can also overwinter in regions where alternative host plants or insect vectors can maintain the viruses during the winter. For example, some weeds or ornamental plants can harbor SPFMV or SPCSV without showing symptoms. Some aphids or whiteflies can also carry the viruses over long distances or migrate to warmer areas during the winter.
Insecticides can be used to control the insect vectors of the disease, such as aphids and whiteflies. However, insecticides may not be effective against all virus strains or insect populations and may have negative impacts on the environment and human health. Some examples of insecticides used for sweet potato plague control are imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, and pyrethroids1. The application dose, period, number of applications, and control effect depend on the product label, the crop stage, the pest pressure, and the local regulations.
Infected plants or plant parts can be removed and destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease. This includes cutting off the infected vines or roots, uprooting and burning the infected plants, or discarding the infected tubers2. Physical measures can also include washing and curing the harvested tubers to reduce the risk of infection during storage or marketing3.
Natural enemies of the insect vectors can be used to reduce their population and limit their transmission of the disease. This includes predators, parasitoids, pathogens, or antagonists of aphids and whiteflies. Some examples of biological control agents for sweet potato plague control are lady beetles, lacewings, parasitic wasps, entomopathogenic fungi, and entomopathogenic nematodes4. Biological control can be enhanced by using cultural practices that favor the natural enemies, such as intercropping, mulching, or planting nectar-rich plants.
Cultural practices that improve the health and resistance of the sweet potato plants can be used to prevent or reduce the severity of the disease. This includes using certified virus-free planting material (roots or slips), rotating sweet potato with non-host crops (such as cereals or legumes), controlling weeds and volunteer plants that may harbor the viruses or vectors, maintaining optimal soil fertility and pH, avoiding water stress or excess moisture, and harvesting at the appropriate time5.
["The leaves become smaller, narrower, twisted, curled, or distorted in shape6.", "The veins of the leaves become pale or yellowish, while the interveinal areas remain green or show a mottled pattern6.", "The plants grow shorter and produce fewer vines than healthy plants6.", "The tubers develop longitudinal cracks on their surface and show brown or black spots inside their flesh6."]
["The viruses that cause sweet potato plague can be detected by using molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These techniques require specialized equipment and laboratory skills.", "Some fungi may interact with the viruses and affect the severity of the disease. For example, <em>Fusarium solani</em> may enhance the replication of SPCSV in sweet potato plants. Fungal structures such as spores or mycelia can be observed by using a microscope or a magnifying lens."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some studies have suggested that resistance to sweet potato plague is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes1. The type of resistance agent is not clear, but some antiviral proteins have been identified in sweet potato plants2. The level of resistance varies among different varieties and regions, but generally sweet potato plague-resistant varieties have lower virus titers and less severe symptoms than susceptible ones2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect the presence of both Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), the two viruses that cause sweet potato plague3. PCR can be performed on leaf or root samples using specific primers for each virus3. Another method is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which can also detect both viruses using specific antibodies4. ELISA can be performed on leaf sap or crude extracts using a microplate reader4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is synergistic interaction between SPFMV and SPCSV, which enhances the replication and movement of both viruses in the plant. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are not well known, but some studies have suggested that the coat protein of SPFMV and the RNA silencing suppressor protein of SPCSV are involved in the synergism. Differences in infestation of different plants depend on the genetic background, environmental conditions, and virus strains of each plant-virus combination. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well studied, but some studies have suggested that genes involved in photosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, monolignol biosynthesis, zeatin biosynthesis, trehalose metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism are differentially expressed in sweet potato plague-infected plants1. These genes may be involved in the pathogenesis or defense mechanisms of sweet potato plague1. Knockout lethal genes are not well identified, but some studies have suggested that genes encoding ribosomal proteins, histones, and DNA repair enzymes are essential for plant survival.
