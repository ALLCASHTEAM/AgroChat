The type of crop of this plant is a staple crop, which means it is a major source of calories and nutrients for many people, especially in developing countries1. Sweet potato is also considered a horticultural crop, which means it is grown for its edible parts, such as roots, leaves, and flowers2. Sweet potato is not usually considered a cash crop, which means it is grown mainly for sale rather than for personal consumption3. The type of disease of this disease is a physiological disease, which means it is caused by a lack or imbalance of nutrients or other environmental factors that affect the normal functioning of the plant. Magnesium deficiency in sweet potato is not caused by a fungus, bacterium, virus, or oomycete.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of this disease is not applicable, because there is no pathogenic fungus involved in this disease. As mentioned above, magnesium deficiency in sweet potato is caused by a lack or imbalance of nutrients or other environmental factors that affect the normal functioning of the plant. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of this disease are dependent on the soil conditions and crop management practices. Magnesium deficiency in sweet potato can occur when the soil has low magnesium content or high levels of potassium or calcium that inhibit magnesium uptake by the plant4. Magnesium deficiency can also occur when the crop is exposed to drought stress, high salinity, low pH, or high temperatures. Magnesium deficiency is not transmitted by air or insects.
The period of disease onset for this disease is variable, depending on the soil conditions and crop management practices. Magnesium deficiency in sweet potato can appear at any stage of growth, but it is more common during periods of rapid growth or fruit development. Magnesium deficiency can also be induced by excessive fertilization with nitrogen or potassium. The environmental conditions required for the disease are unfavorable for magnesium availability or uptake by the plant. Magnesium deficiency in sweet potato can be caused by low magnesium content in the soil or high levels of potassium or calcium that inhibit magnesium uptake by the plant4. Magnesium deficiency can also be caused by drought stress, high salinity, low pH, or high temperatures that affect the plant's ability to absorb or transport magnesium.
The overwintering method of this disease is not applicable, because magnesium deficiency in sweet potato does not persist in the soil or plant tissues. Magnesium deficiency in sweet potato can be corrected by applying magnesium fertilizers or foliar sprays to the soil or plant leaves. Magnesium deficiency can also be prevented by using appropriate crop rotation, soil testing, liming, irrigation, and fertilization practices.
According to one source1, a magnesium deficiency can be treated with an all-around fertilizer that contains magnesium.
Another source2 suggests applying magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) at a rate of 25 kg/ha as a foliar spray or through irrigation water. Alternatively, dolomite lime can be applied to the soil to increase the magnesium availability.


["One of the main symptoms of magnesium deficiency is yellowing leaves1 3, especially on the older leaves. The yellowing occurs between the veins, while the veins remain green.", "This is because magnesium is used by the plant to make chlorophyll, which gives the leaves their green color. The yellowing may also be accompanied by brown spots or necrosis3 on the leaf margins or interveinal areas."]
["Magnesium deficiency is not caused by a pathogen, but by a lack of magnesium in the soil or in the plant tissue.", "Therefore, there are no disease signs of this disease, such as fungal substrates or bacterial secretions.", "However, a soil test or a plant tissue analysis can be used to confirm the diagnosis of magnesium deficiency by measuring the magnesium levels in the soil or in the plant2."]
