Sweet potato is a horticultural crop that is grown for its edible tuberous roots and leaves1. Sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) is a viral disease caused by the co-infection of two viruses: sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) and sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV)2. SPFMV is transmitted by aphids, while SPCSV is transmitted by whiteflies3.
The pathogenic viruses of SPVD do not reproduce by spores, but by replicating their genomes inside the host cells using their own or host-encoded enzymes4. The viruses then assemble new virus particles that are released from the cells and infect new cells or plants. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of SPVD are as follows:Aphid transmission: SPFMV is transmitted by several species of aphids in a nonpersistent manner, meaning that the virus does not multiply or persist in the aphid vector. The aphids acquire the virus by probing infected plants and transmit it to healthy plants within a few minutes. The transmission efficiency depends on the aphid species, the virus strain, and the environmental conditions5.Whitefly transmission: SPCSV is transmitted by the sweet potato whitefly ( Bemisia tabaci ) in a semi-persistent manner, meaning that the virus can persist in the whitefly vector for a few hours or days. The whiteflies acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants and transmit it to healthy plants after a latent period of 6 to 24 hours. The transmission efficiency depends on the whitefly biotype, the virus strain, and the environmental conditions.Vegetative propagation: Both SPFMV and SPCSV can be transmitted through vegetative propagation of infected plant material, such as vines, root slips, or tubers. This is the most common and efficient way of spreading the disease, especially in regions where insect vectors are scarce or absent.
The period of disease onset for SPVD depends on several factors, such as the time of infection, the virus strains, the host genotype, and the environmental conditions. Generally, SPVD symptoms appear earlier and are more severe when plants are infected at an early stage of growth, when both viruses are present at high concentrations, when susceptible varieties are grown, and when temperatures are high and rainfall is low. The environmental conditions required for SPVD are as follows:Temperature: SPVD is more prevalent and severe in warm regions with temperatures above 25 в„ѓ (77 в„ѓ). High temperatures favor the multiplication and movement of both viruses within the plant, as well as the activity and reproduction of insect vectors.Humidity: SPVD is more prevalent and severe in dry regions with low rainfall and high evaporation. Low humidity reduces the resistance of plants to viral infection and increases the feeding behavior of insect vectors.Soil conditions: SPVD is not affected by soil conditions directly, but indirectly through their influence on plant growth and vigor. Poor soil fertility, low soil moisture, high soil salinity, or soil-borne pests and diseases can reduce plant vigor and increase susceptibility to viral infection.
The overwintering method of SPVD is not clear, but it is possible that both viruses survive in infected plant material or insect vectors that remain alive during winter. Infected tubers can serve as a source of inoculum for the next season if they are used as planting material or if they sprout volunteer plants. Infected vines or root slips can also serve as a source of inoculum if they are stored or transported under favorable conditions. Infected aphids or whiteflies can overwinter on alternative host plants or in protected places and transmit the viruses to new plants in spring.
There is no effective chemical control for this disease, as the viruses are transmitted by insects that are difficult to control with insecticides1.
Infected plants should be removed and destroyed as soon as possible to prevent further spread of the disease2. Cuttings used for propagation should be obtained from healthy plants or virus-free sources1.
There is no known biological control for this disease1.
Crop rotation, intercropping, weed management, and use of resistant or tolerant varieties can help reduce the incidence and severity of the disease1 2.
["Leaf reduction and deformation: The leaves become smaller, narrower, and distorted in shape3 2.", "Vein clearing or mosaic: The veins of the leaves become pale or yellow, and the leaf lamina shows a mottled pattern of green and yellow patches3 2.", "Stunting: The plants grow poorly and have reduced biomass and yield3 2.", "Chlorosis: The leaves become yellow or pale green, especially along the margins4 2.", "Necrosis: The leaves develop brown or black spots or lesions that may coalesce and cause leaf death4 2."]
["The presence of the causal viruses in the plant tissues, which can be detected by serological or molecular methods such as ELISA, PCR, or RT-PCR1.", "The presence of the vector insects on the plants, such as aphids (for SPFMV) or whiteflies (for SPCSV), which can be observed by visual inspection or trapping methods1."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but some studies have suggested that resistance to SPVD is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes1. The type of resistance agent is not clear, but some antiviral proteins have been identified in sweetpotato plants2. The level of resistance varies among different varieties and regions, but generally SPVD-resistant varieties have lower virus titers and less severe symptoms than susceptible ones2. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect the presence of both Sweetpotato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) and Sweetpotato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), the two viruses that cause SPVD3. PCR can be performed on leaf or root samples using specific primers for each virus3. Another method is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which can also detect both viruses using specific antibodies4. ELISA can be performed on leaf sap or crude extracts using a microplate reader4. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is synergistic interaction between SPFMV and SPCSV, which enhances the replication and movement of both viruses in the plant5. The type and number of pathogenic effectors are not well known, but some studies have suggested that the coat protein of SPFMV and the RNA silencing suppressor protein of SPCSV are involved in the synergism5. Differences in infestation of different plants depend on the genetic background, environmental conditions, and virus strains of each plant-virus combination5. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are not well studied, but some studies have suggested that genes involved in photosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, monolignol biosynthesis, zeatin biosynthesis, trehalose metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism are differentially expressed in SPVD-infected plants1. These genes may be involved in the pathogenesis or defense mechanisms of SPVD1. Knockout lethal genes are not well identified, but some studies have suggested that genes encoding ribosomal proteins, histones, and DNA repair enzymes are essential for plant survival.
