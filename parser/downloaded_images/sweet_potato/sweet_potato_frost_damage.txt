The type of crop of sweet potato is a horticultural crop1 2, belonging to the morning-glory family (Convolvulaceae)1 3. It originated in South America and is one of the most important food crops in the developing world1. The type of disease of frost damage on sweet potato is a physiological disease, caused by low temperatures that affect the roots and vines of the plant. Frost damage can result in chilling injury, internal decay, reduced yield and quality, and increased susceptibility to pathogens4 5 6.
The mode of reproduction of the pathogenic fungus of frost damage on sweet potato is not applicable, since frost damage is not caused by a fungus but by low temperatures. However, some fungal pathogens that can infect sweet potatoes after frost damage are Fusarium solani, Rhizopus stolonifer, and Ceratocystis fimbriata. These fungi can produce conidia or sporangiospores as their asexual spores. The epidemiological pattern and mode of transmission of frost damage on sweet potato are environmental and abiotic, meaning that they depend on the weather conditions and not on living organisms. Frost damage can occur when the air temperature drops below 32В°F (0В°C) or when the soil temperature drops below 50В°F (10В°C)7 5. Frost damage can spread through the plant tissue by affecting the cell membranes, enzymes, and water balance.
The period of disease onset for frost damage on sweet potato is variable, depending on the weather conditions and the stage of growth of the plant. Frost damage can occur at any time during the growing season, but it is more likely to happen in late fall or early spring, when the temperatures are more unpredictable5 6. Frost damage can also occur during storage, if the roots are exposed to low temperatures4. The environmental conditions required for frost damage on sweet potato are low temperatures below 32В°F (0В°C) for the vines and below 50В°F (10В°C) for the roots4 5. Other factors that can increase the risk of frost damage are high humidity, cloudy days, windy nights, poor drainage, and heavy soils5 6.
The overwintering method of frost damage on sweet potato is not applicable, since frost damage is not a living organism that can survive over winter. However, some methods to prevent or reduce frost damage on sweet potato are: planting early-maturing varieties, using black plastic mulch or row covers to keep the soil warm, harvesting before a hard frost, curing the roots at 85В°F (29В°C) for 4 to 7 days after harvest, and storing the roots at 55 to 60В°F (13 to 16В°C) with high humidity5 6 8.
One of the best ways to prevent frost damage is to harvest the sweet potatoes before the first frost, or as soon as possible after a light frost1 2. Frost can cause decay and chilling injury to the roots, especially near the surface1 3.
If a frost is forecasted, water the sweet potato vines thoroughly and cover them with plastic sheets over bamboo stakes to protect them from the cold temperatures2 3. This can help the vines survive a light frost and keep the soil warm2.
If a frost has already occurred and killed the vines, cut them off right above the soil as soon as possible to prevent decay from spreading to the roots1. This may allow you to leave the roots in the ground for a few more days without injury1.
After harvesting, cure the sweet potato roots by resting them at 85 degrees Fahrenheit for 4 to 7 days with 90 to 95 percent relative humidity2. This can help heal any wounds and improve storage quality2.
["Frost damage can cause various symptoms on sweet potato roots, such as darkening, softening, shriveling, cracking, and rotting3 4. These symptoms can reduce the quality and yield of the crop3 4.", "Frost damage can also affect the vines of sweet potatoes, causing them to wilt, blacken, and die1 2 3. This can reduce the photosynthesis and water uptake of the plant, and expose the roots to cold air temperatures4."]
["Frost damage is not caused by a pathogen, but by low temperatures that injure the plant cells and tissues3 4. Therefore, there are no disease signs of sweetpotato frost damage, such as fungal substrates or bacterial secretions.", "However, frost damage can make the sweetpotato roots more susceptible to secondary infections by pathogens, such as fungi and bacteria3 4. These pathogens can produce disease signs on the roots, such as mycelia, spores, ooze, or lesions3 4."]
The resistance of the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not well studied, but one possible mechanism is the detoxification of plant glucosinolate hydrolysis products, which are toxic to many pathogens and herbivores. The fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which causes white mold on sweet potato and other crops, can metabolize isothiocyanates (ITCs), the main products of glucosinolate hydrolysis, via two pathways: conjugation to glutathione and hydrolysis to amines. The latter pathway involves an isothiocyanate hydrolase that converts ITCs into non-toxic products1. The isothiocyanate hydrolase also contributes to the virulence of the fungus on glucosinolate-producing plants1. 
A quick test method for the phytopathogenic fungus of the disease is not available, as far as I could find. The diagnosis of fungal diseases usually requires microscopic examination, culture isolation, molecular detection or serological assays2. However, these methods may be time-consuming, expensive or require specialized equipment and expertise2. A rapid and simple method for detecting fungal pathogens in plants is still needed. 
The mechanism of phytopathogenic infestation of the disease is also not well understood, but some general aspects can be mentioned. Phytopathogenic fungi can infect plants through natural openings (such as stomata and lenticels) or wounds caused by insects, other pathogens or mechanical damage2. They can also produce enzymes that degrade plant cell walls and penetrate into plant tissues2. Some fungi can secrete toxins or hormones that interfere with plant metabolism and defense2. Some fungi can also inject effector molecules into plant cells to suppress host responses or manipulate host physiology1. The type and number of pathogenic effectors may vary depending on the fungal species and strain, as well as the host plant species and genotype1. For example, S. sclerotiorum has been shown to secrete at least 49 different effectors that target different plant processes1. The differences in infestation of different plants may depend on the compatibility between the fungal effectors and the plant receptors or immune components1. 
The potential targets of the phytopathogenic bacteria of the disease are also not clear, but one possible target is the plant genome itself. Some phytopathogenic bacteria, such as Agrobacterium rhizogenes and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, are capable of transferring DNA fragments (transfer DNA or T-DNA) bearing functional genes into the host plant genome3. This process can result in genetic transformation or modification of the plant, which may affect its growth, development or susceptibility to other pathogens3. Interestingly, it has been reported that the genome of cultivated sweet potato contains T-DNA sequences from Agrobacterium species3, suggesting that this crop has been naturally transgenic for thousands of years3. However, the role and impact of these T-DNA sequences on sweet potato biology and disease resistance are still unknown.
